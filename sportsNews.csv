"Modi confirms 2036 Olympics bid | The Daily Star","""Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed Saturday that his country would bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympics and become just the fourth Asian nation to stage the Games. The world's most populous country is this weekend holding a session of the International Olympic Committee's executive board, which has already resolved to include cricket -- India's most popular sport -- at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles. Modi made the bid announcement while formally opening the meeting after months of hints from members of his government, saying it was the """"dream and aspiration"""" of India's 1.4 billion people. """"India will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to organise the 2036 Olympics,"""" he said. Modi did not mention which city would apply to host the Olympics. But media reports have speculated that Ahmedabad, capital of his home state of Gujarat, was the most likely city to bid. Ahmedabad is home to Narendra Modi Stadium, named for the prime minister and with 132,000 seats, the world's largest sporting venue by capacity. The formal announcement comes just two months after sports minister Anurag Thakur said India was now home to """"top global infrastructure"""" that left it ready to stage the Olympics. """"There should be no question about India's competence,"""" The Hindu newspaper quoted Thakur as saying. India this year held the presidency of the G20 and was roundly praised for its smooth hosting of the world's most powerful leaders. Modi said Saturday that the G20 summit's success was proof that the country was ready to put on """"mega global events"""". But India has struggled to stage large-scale sporting competitions in the past. New Delhi's hosting of the Commonwealth Games in 2010 was marked by construction delays, substandard infrastructure and accusations of financial mismanagement and corruption. India is currently hosting the Cricket World Cup, and was criticised for a delay in announcing the tournament fixture until three months before it began. The schedule was suddenly overhauled a few weeks after it was first published with some of the biggest matches rescheduled. Fans have meanwhile complained about online ticketing crashes, and matches not featuring the hosts have been sparsely attended. Modi's announcement came just moments after India beat Pakistan in the World Cup's most anticipated fixture. Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and Poland are so far the only other countries committed to bidding for 2036. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

The Bangladesh team reached Pune earlier today on a chartered flight. The most anticipated match of the 2023 World Cup will begin today when hosts India take on archrivals Pakistan at the 132,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, the largest cricket stadium in the world. New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been ruled out of the team's immediate World Cup matches with a fractured thumb, but head coach Gary Stead is optimistic the batter will be back in action at some stage of the tournament. With their green shirts drowning in a sea of blue, Mohammad Uzair and Asif Syed Ali were a rare sight in Ahmedabad -- two Pakistan fans in an Indian dominated crowd of around 120,000 witnessing the biggest show in cricket. Pakistan reached 79-2 in 15 overs in front of a crowd dominated by Indian spectators after delays in visas for Pakistan fans. India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and asked Pakistan to bat first in their highly-anticipated clash of the World Cup at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad today.

Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan was taken for a scan after his match against New Zealand in the ICC World Cup at the Chepauk in Chennai on Friday. Bangladesh ODI vice-captain Najmul Hossain Shanto lamented his side’s top-order batting on a good wicket as they went down in a comprehensive eight-wicket defeat at the hands of New Zealand at the Chepauk in Chennai on Friday.

Commemorating Lay’s ‘Made In Bangladesh’ initiative, Lay’s have released a light-hearted ad that shows the cricketers engaged in a friendly banter while celebrating their shared love for made-in-Bangladesh Lay’s chips. Twenty-eight sports are already confirmed on the schedule but cricket was one of five new sports formally proposed for inclusion by organisers for the Games on Monday. “Look at the other small countries, they have improved.

The third edition of Hadudu for people above 60 years of age has been held in Manikganj The last time Bangladesh made it to the final of the Asia Cup was in 2018 when the latest 50-over edition of the tournament was played. The Tigers beat Pakistan to qualify for the final and lost to eventual champions India. But Pakistan’s eleven has come a long way from what it was in 2018 and is mighty strong, especially when it comes to their fast bowling. Bangladesh have made the Asia Cup final three times but are still searching for their first trophy. Can Shakib Al Hasan’s side put an end to their trophy hunt? The wait continues but before that let’s take a look at Bangladesh’s strengths, weaknesses, and chances of winning. The Tigers begin their Asia Cup mission with an encounter against Sri Lanka. Can the Tigers trump the Lankans in their opening fixture? To discuss all of this and much more, The Daily Star brings you Star Non-Striker’s End. Pakistan would be forgiven for feeling like gladiators thrown into the Colosseum when they face an India team egged on by 100,000-plus fans in Saturday's World Cup blockbuster, but skipper Babar Azam sees the match as a chance to end a jinx against their arch-rivals. Despite losing their second consecutive game in the World Cup, pacer Mustafizur Rahman still feels that Bangladesh can win their remaining six matches of the group stage and qualify for the semifinals. Kane Williamson made 78 on his long-awaited return to lead New Zealand to an eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh at the World Cup on Friday but was forced to retire hurt with a hand injury.

"'India-Pakistan match didn't seem like an ICC event' | The Daily Star","""Pakistan team director Mickey Arthur was upset by the lack of their fans at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Saturday but would not blame the team's comprehensive defeat by India on the absence of support from the stands. The late unveiling of the tournament's schedule had already made it difficult for fans from abroad to plan their tour of India for the 13th edition of the showpiece event. Soured political relations between the Asian neighbours has further complicated the issue and the Pakistan Cricket Board has asked the governing International Cricket Council (ICC) to sort out visa delays for their fans and media travelling to India. Almost an entirely Indian crowd of 100,000-plus fans turned the entire stadium into a sea of blue jerseys and Arthur felt the tournament, hosted by the Indian board (BCCI), lacked the flavour of a global event. """"It didn't seem like an ICC event to be brutally honest,"""" the former Australia coach said after Pakistan's seven-wicket loss. """"It seemed like a bilateral series, it seemed like a BCCI event. """"I didn't hear 'Dil Dil Pakistan' coming through the microphones too often tonight,"""" he said, referring to the unofficial anthem for the country. """"So yes, that does play a role, but I'm not going to use that as an excuse because for us it was about living the moment, it was about the next ball and it was about how we were going to combat the Indian players tonight."""" Only half a dozen Pakistani journalists arrived on the eve of the match and the ICC said they were trying to sort out the visa issues.

India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli -- both for 16 -- before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory.

"New Zealand have 'good information' on Bangladesh, says Conway | The Daily Star","""New Zealand know all about the threat posed by Bangladesh after playing the Asian side in the build-up to the Cricket World Cup, opener Devon Conway said ahead of the sides' meeting in Chennai later on Friday. New Zealand took on Bangladesh last month as part of their preparations for the 50-overs showpiece in India, beating them 2-0 in a One-Day International series and chalking up sizeable margins of victory in both matches. The Black Caps have brought that form into the World Cup, thrashing defending champions England by nine wickets in the opener before beating the Netherlands by 99 runs to sit second in the table. """"We couldn't have asked for a better start with two wins and four points. The guys are excited to get out there and put up a good show against Bangladesh,"""" Conway said. """"Bangladesh are a strong group, we're fortunate to have played a fair few ODI games against them recently. We've got good information on the group and how they go about things. """"They are crafty with the ball, they've got some good spinners and some good seamers up front as well."""" The 32-year-old said he was pleased that team mate Rachin Ravindra, with whom he combined for an unbroken 273-run partnership in the win over England, was getting the recognition he deserved. In addition to his 123 against England, all-rounder Ravindra also scored a half-century against the Netherlands and has picked up two wickets so far. """"That partnership we shared in Ahmedabad was special. It's great to see him show the world what he's got,"""" Conway said.

"Shakib ‘under observation’ as Tigers regroup | The Daily Star","""The Bangladesh cricket team landed in Pune yesterday ahead of their next World Cup encounter against India, as they awaited the medical report of skipper Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib was hurt in Friday's World Cup fixture in Chennai and had to leave the pitch before the Bangladesh-New Zealand match ended in Chennai - owing to a left quadriceps injury. He was taken for a scan after the game. His availability for Bangladesh's fourth World Cup fixture, on October 19 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, hinged on the MRI scan report - which were due to arrive yesterday. Bangladesh physio Bayjedul Islam Khan did not reveal the results at the end of the day but informed that Shakib's fitness for the upcoming matches will be """"under observation"""". """"We will clinically assess his day-to-day progress and take measures accordingly,"""" he added. The game's opening innings saw the ace all-rounder suffer from cramping while batting. He tried to hit his way out of trouble, but it cost him his wicket. Later, Shakib was seen standing at the slip before leaving the field early after bowling out the full quota of 10 overs. Bangladesh suffered their second consecutive defeat in the tournament after falling to New Zealand by an eight-wicket margin. It will thus be crucial for the Tigers to regroup before their next game. The Tigers are scheduled to resume training on October 17 as the team management decided to give the cricketers a two-day rest in Pune to recover from the physical and emotional stress of the crushing defeats to England and New Zealand. """"We should have a good rest. The danger here is that the World Cup games come thick and fast,"""" Bangladesh assistant coach, Nic Pothas, told the media on Friday. """"They are high-pressure [matches]. These games take a lot out of you. You get into a more-is-more situation. You think more practice helps but it doesn't. We will be giving the players a good amount of mental and physical rest to help prepare for India,"""" added the South African coach. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's failure at the top-order in all three World Cup matches has drawn attention towards the repeated reshuffling of the batting order, prompting harsh criticism from all quarters. Mehedi Hasan Miraz was dropped to number five against England after making a fifty against Afghanistan - before returning to number three against New Zealand. Najmul Hossain Shanto, who had been nurtured as the number three batter over around the past year and had scored substantially in that position, batted fourth against Afghanistan in the first game. The 25-year-old batted at number three against England, but was moved to number four again against New Zealand. Towhid Hridoy, another young batter who made his mark since making his ODI debut at number five and scored over 500 runs this year in that position, has batted at number seven so far in the World Cup. According to Pothas, the batters are aware of their roles. """"This is modern cricket. The batters know that they have to be flexible and adaptable. They are all dependent on our opposition and conditions. A lot of thought goes into [the batting-order],"""" said Pothas.

"Sometimes cramps, sometimes acting: Rizwan quips after match-winning knock | Pakistan Beat Sri Lanka By 6 Wickets | The Daily Star","""Pakistan's wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan hit a match-winning century against Sri Lanka in Hyderabad on Tuesday, which powered Pakistan to the highest successful run-chase ever in an ICC ODI World Cup match. Rizwan remained unbeaten on 131 off 121 balls as Pakistan chased down a 345-run target with six wickets in hand and 10 balls to spare at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. But on his way to a match-winning knock, Rizwan had to battle through exhaustion, back pain and cramps. In the 36th over of the chase, Rizwan fell to the ground holding his back after seemingly hurting his back a couple of deliveries ago while trying to reach for a wide delivery. After receiving some treatment from the Pakistan team physio, Rizwan was back on his feet. In the following over, Rizwan charged down the wicket to Dhananjata de Silva and sent the ball over the ropes through the long-off region. But in the followthrough of that stroke, he collapsed to the ground in a rather dramatic fashion, clutching his right calf. The physio again rushed to the middle, treated him for the cramps and Rizwan was soon ready to resume his innings. After the match, when Rizwan was asked about his struggles in the middle after being named the player of the match, the 31-year-old gave a lighthearted response. """"Sometimes cramps, sometimes acting (smiles),"""" Rizwan said at the post-match presentation. Rizwan and Abdullah Shafique, who made 113 off 103 balls, formed a 176-run partnership for the third wicket which set up the record chase for Pakistan. Rizwan revealed that even after losing two early wickets, the Pakistan team believed they could win the match. """"Every player in the dressing room had the belief we can chase that.

"Shakib’s toughest test yet | Bangladesh cricket world cup 2023 | The Daily Star","""Four years back, the country's top all-rounder, Shakib Al Hasan, was engulfed by the type of pressure that all athletes feel at least once in their careers: the pressure of not performing on the field. Like any champion professional, Shakib passed in flying colours. Instead of getting weighed down by the burden of being sidelined by his Indian Premier League outfit for most of the games that season, Shakib rose gloriously as he made the 2019 World Cup in England his own. He took 11 wickets and scored 606 runs in eight games, surpassing the record of Sachin Tendulkar for most runs in a World Cup group stage. The strain of dealing with an ICC investigation for failing to report corrupt approaches was also on the all-rounder, but that was all his to cope with because that dark period of his career was only revealed a few months after the mega event that year. Four years on, Shakib is all set for another World Cup as the Tigers begin their campaign today by taking on Afghanistan in Dharamshala. This will be his fifth overall appearance in the apex event and second as the captain of Bangladesh after having led the side in the 2011 edition. Have the controversies surrounding the 36-year-old died down? Not at all -- albeit unsurprising for a cricketer who rarely keeps his wiles reserved only for the field. Things have unfolded in a different and a much uglier manner for Shakib this time around. Not only the issues are mostly a creation of his own, but also none pertains to on-field cricket and have already been laid bare in public. A public feud between the Bangladesh captain and his long-time national team comrade Tamim Iqbal, the country's finest opener, has practically divided the nation into two parts -- a very unusual and unprecedented development considering how the opposite always happens for any country going into a world event. Shakib only made things worse, flinging mud and throwing accusations of 'not being a team man' at Tamim during an explosive interview with T Sports just before leaving the country for the World Cup in India. Shakib knew how his statements were going to be taken, fuelling even further the already raging clash of egos between the two stalwarts, and even their fanbases, while making a mockery of Bangladesh cricket and its governing body, the Bangladesh Cricket Board. The all-rounder has almost never let any off-field issue catch up to him while on it. But this time, it is a different challenge altogether even for someone as nonchalant as Shakib. If he goes on to live by his words, it will be the 36-year-old's World Cup swansong. But more important than that is he is in charge of a team that have lost way in their most favoured format amid all the hullabaloo. His 2019 campaign was exceptional, but only on a personal level. What he needs to do in 2023 is much more wide-reaching. Unlike what Shakib had said in that interview -- that he would have preferred to just focus on his own game this World Cup -- the 36-year-old will need to gel the whole team together not only by performing on the field but also by making everyone else flourish through his leadership. Maybe only then the people of the country will once again be united, rallying behind the team as it should have been from the onset. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Will the wait for WC squad end today? | The Daily Star","""With September 28 being the cut-off date to submit the final squad for the upcoming ICC ODI World Cup in India, the national selectors are expected to announce the Bangladesh squad for the mega event soon. Bangladesh are scheduled to travel to Guwahati and kick off their World Cup campaign on September 27, a day after playing the third and final ODI against New Zealand in Mirpur tomorrow. According to sources, the selectors have already chalked out the squad and are only awaiting the final approval from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon. It was also learned that the BCB boss is willing to have a discussion with the Tigers' head coach Chandika Hathurusingha before finalising the Tigers' squad for the mega event. Deciding on a possible last-minute inclusion of Mahmudullah Riyad in the World Cup squad is apparently the biggest reason behind the delay of the Tigers' squad announcement. Riyad, making a comeback to the side after nearly six months, made a statement with a 49-run knock after the Tigers suffered a batting collapse in their second ODI against New Zealand on Saturday. Chasing a 255-run target, Bangladesh suffered an 86-run thumping as they were bundled out for 168. It will be interesting to see whether Riyad eventually makes it to the squad. Meanwhile, there are some changes in Bangladesh's squad for the third and series-deciding encounter against the Kiwis tomorrow. Stand-in captain Liton Das and Tamim Iqbal have been rested for the game. Najmul Hossain Shanto, making a return to the side since recovering from a hamstring injury, will lead the Tigers in the game. Experienced Mushfiqur Rahim, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, and pacer Shoriful Islam have also been included in the squad.

"Tigers spoilt for choice over pacers | The Daily Star","""From a team that only ever tried to 'spin to win', Bangladesh have now evolved into a pace-centric attack heading into the ICC World Cup in India. This rise of the pace unit in recent years has emboldened the team management to bet on the fast bowlers and name five specialist quicks in the 15-man World Cup squad. Bangladesh will now be looking towards the likes of Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and young Tanzim Hasan Sakib, who replaced an injured Ebadot Hossain, to make an impact in the mega event in India. The last time Bangladeshi pacers had delivered in a major way for the team in a World Cup was in the 2015 edition in Australia. The pacer who was the X-factor of the Bangladesh team in that World Cup was Rubel Hossain. Rubel's fuller delivery uprooting the stumps of James Anderson and then him celebrating like a man possessed after taking the team to the quarterfinal of a World Cup for the very first time is one of the most iconic moments in the history of Bangladesh cricket. Rubel has faith in the current lot of fast bowlers and believes they can look into the eyes of the other top pace attacks in the world and provide more of such iconic moments in the coming World Cup. """"I think we are going to witness some interesting battles among the pacers of different teams in this World Cup and I would like to see our pacers put their hands up and deliver,"""" Rubel told the Daily Star. """"There are teams like Pakistan, Australia and India who have got some quality pacers but I expect our pacers to deliver this time around. If the batters can post enough runs on the board and give something for the bowlers to defend, I am confident our bowlers have the ability to restrict the opponent batters,"""" he added. Rubel's faith on the pace attack is backed by stats as in the 20 ODIs Bangladesh have played in 2023, the pacers have picked up 85 wickets whereas the spinners have claimed 50 scalps. Taskin has been the highest wicket-taker for Bangladesh in ODIs this year as the seamer has bagged 21 wickets in 11 matches and has shown great consistency with the ball. Hasan has picked up 17 wickets and left-arm pacer Shoriful has 16 wickets to his name in the same period. Tanzim, who made his ODI debut in the series against India, has a couple of wickets in two ODIs while the experienced Mustafiz has taken 15 wickets in 2023. Rubel is also excited by the variety in the Bangladesh attack and feels that captain Shakib Al Hasan will be spoilt for choices in terms of pacers in the World Cup. """"I think we have a good balance in the team and our pace department has been doing really well in recent times. All the pacers have proved what they are capable of and I think we have good variety in our attack,"""" said the 33-year-old. """"We have bowlers like Taskin who can bowl fast and attack the batters, Mustafiz brings in a lot of experience in the bowling unit and I think he will have a big role to play in Indian conditions with his variations. """"The likes of Hasan, Shoriful and Tanzim have also impressed with their slower deliveries and yorkers.

"Tigers surrender to Kiwi short ball barrage | The Daily Star","""For a moment, imagine that you didn't see Friday's World Cup match between Bangladesh and New Zealand. Someone tells you that one of the teams got restricted to 245 after batting the entire 50 overs in Chennai. If you had been following the reports from local media leading up to the match, you most likely would have presumed that this was the result of spinners once again ruling the roost in Chennai. If you are a fan of Bangladesh cricket, you had probably hoped that it was the Tigers who had strangled the Kiwis with their spin attack as expectations were that the ball would turn square at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, much like it did during the World Cup match between India and Australia. However, a quick glance at the scorecard shows that none of the spinners were able to leave their mark in the game – neither from Bangladesh nor from New Zealand, as on Friday, the Kiwi pacers stole the show. The nature of the pitch came as a surprise for the fans. But both teams had read the pitch beforehand which was apparent from their playing XIs. New Zealand didn't drop a pacer to play an extra spinner while Bangladesh dropped spinner Mahedi Hasan for batter Mahmudullah. Express pacer Lockie Ferguson kept darting in lethal bouncers aimed at the heads of the Bangladesh batters. Other Kiwi pacers -- Trent Boult and Matt Henry -- also kept pitching the ball short. They did so, responding to the different nature of the wicket. India availed the home advantage against Australia and stung them on a spin friendly 22 yards. The Bangladesh-New Zealand match happened at the same ground but on a different pitch, where there was bounce on offer for the pacers. Kiwi pacers took full advantage of the licence to bowl two short balls in an over as they fulfilled that quota in seemingly every over. Commentator Sanjay Manjrekar pointed out 56 percent of the balls delivered by the New Zealand pacers were pitched in short. According to ESPNcricinfo, 45 of Ferguson's 60 legal deliveries in the match were pitched either in the short length area or short of a good length. Let's take a look at the 12th over of the Bangladesh innings for example. Ferguson bowled a bouncer in the second delivery, the following ball was also a bouncer but was declared a wide for height. Just one ball later, Ferguson again pitched the ball short. And this time, Mehedi Hasan Miraz fell into his trap and offered a catch at fine-leg. The same tactic was applied against Mushfiqur Rahim. But he handled that line of attack very well, even hitting a few boundaries. But skipper Shakib Al Hasan lost his wicket to a short-pitched delivery. Bangladesh batters are susceptible against short pitch bowling. As per ESPNcricinfo, Bangladesh batter have a strike rate of 85 against that type of bowling in the past two years -- the lowest among all teams in the World Cup. The Tigers are also amongst the three teams with the lowest average against short balls. In the post-match presentation ceremony, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said they decided to adopt the short-ball approach midway into the first Powerplay. Ferguson said there was more bounce on offer in Chennai compared to Hyderabad, where New Zealand had played their previous two matches in the World Cup. New Zealand bowled 31 overs of pace, where they claimed seven wickets for 163 runs. Their pacers averaged 23.28, which is the best amongst all pace attacks in Chennai in the past 10 years in matches where the pacers have at least claimed five wickets. Bangladesh pacers, on the other hand, had a comical average of 135 -- the worst ever in Chennai in matches where teams had bowled at least 20 overs of pace. The Bangladesh quicks bowled 23.5 overs, gave away 135 runs and took just one wicket. In the end, the match wasn't a battle between spin attacks, as the media had speculated. It was a game where New Zealand unleashed a short ball barrage and the Bangladesh batters meekly surrendered. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Kane Williamson 'excited' to return against Bangladesh | The Daily Star","""New Zealand captain Kane Williamson confirmed that he will be making his return to international cricket with his side's third match in the ICC ODI World Cup against Bangladesh at the MA Chidambaram stadium in Chennai on Friday. Williamson had ruptured his ACL in March this year during the opening match of the 16th Indian Premier League (IPL) and had to undergo a knee surgery. Though he wasn't fully fit, the New Zealand selectors named the 33-year-old in their World Cup squad. Williamson travelled with the team during their tour of England in August and September and even batted in the practice game against Pakistan before the tournament, where he made a half-century. Still, Williamson sat out New Zealand's first two matches in the competition, as he was not yet a hundred percent fit. But New Zealand will have their regular skipper with them in their third World Cup game against the Tigers on Friday. """"It's been quite a journey but largely a good one that's had some really good progress. I've said a number of times, really excited to be named in the World Cup squad, be sitting here now and really excited at the prospect of tomorrow,"""" Williamson told the media on Thursday. """"A new venue, new opposition, as we know, which always happens in world events. And we're looking forward to the challenge,"""" he added. But it's not all good news for the Kiwis as experienced pacer Tim Southee still hasn't recovered from his injury and won't be playing against the Tigers, confirmed Williamson. The MA Chidambaram Stadium lived up to its reputation of being a spinners heaven in the match between India and Australia, where the Indian spinners bundled out the Aussies for just 199. Bangladesh will be banking on their spin attack to come good on the track, while New Zealand will also hope that the likes of Ish Sodhi, Mitchel Santner and Rachin Ravindra will play their part against the Tigers. Williamson feels that spinners will play a huge role in Friday's game in Chennai. """"We have seen here that there's been that spin and the pitch has varied perhaps as the games moved on as well so throughout the day - but definitely I think both teams have some good spin bowlers that no doubt will play a big part tomorrow.

India bowled out Pakistan for 191 after their rivals collapsed from 155-2. They overhauled the total with 117 balls to spare to extend their unbeaten streak against their neighbours to eight in the 50-over showpiece tournament. Rohit stood out in his 63-ball knock laced with six fours and six sixes to keep India, who began the event as favourites to win the title, unbeaten in their three matches in this edition. Pakistan now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament. """"It felt good,"""" said man of the match, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah who had figures of 2-19 off nine overs.

Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world's number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman's gloves.

"Rain forces India-Pakistan Asia Cup clash into reserve day | The Daily Star","""Rain on Sunday forced a blockbuster clash between India and Pakistan into a reserve day after just 24.1 overs of play in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup. India will resume on 147-2 on Monday in the 50-over contest after rain abruptly ended their innings following Pakistan's decision to bowl first in Colombo. An extra day was a last-minute addition to the Super Four clash -- the only game to get the advantage other than the final -- after a previous group meeting between the two teams was washed out due to rain in Pallekele. Rain in Sri Lanka, who co-host the tournament alongside Pakistan, has put the organisers in a spin. The tournament is a precursor to the upcoming ODI World Cup. Virat Kohli, on eight, and KL Rahul, on 17, were batting when rain forced the players off and groundstaff worked tirelessly to try and restart the game after showers stopped. After three inspections, the umpires looked like restarting play, but rain came to have the final say. Skipper Rohit Sharma (56) and fellow opener Shubman Gill (58) gave India a blazing start in a stand of 121 off 100 balls to put Pakistan on the backfoot. The batsmen took on the new-ball pair of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah with aerial shots in the powerplay when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle. Both Shaheen and Naseem looked menacing in their first spell as the ball kept flying past the bat, and one edge from Gill went between two slips. Rohit smashed leg-spinner Shadab Khan for two sixes and a four off successive balls in a 19-run over to raise the noise of the Indian fans at a largely empty stadium. Shadab redeemed himself after the first drinks interval to send back Rohit caught out, and Shaheen returned to get Gill in the next over. Scoring dipped as Kohli and Rahul looked to rebuild before rain intervened. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Let the drums roll | India vs Pakistan | The Daily Star","""As the much-anticipated World Cup clash between India and Pakistan unfolds in Ahmedabad today, cricket fans, regardless of their allegiances, are poised to savour every sumptuous bit of action. No other cricketing rivalry comes close to matching the magnitude of the one between India and Pakistan, and very few sporting events can claim to be able to attract billions of fans. When it comes to the World Cups, the excitement surrounding the match inevitably reaches fever pitch; to such an extent that the final match of the tournament ends up taking a back seat in terms of the anticipation factor. A crown jewel of World Cup matches, no doubt; the two teams had lived up to the billing, time and again, producing timeless moments of dramatic affairs and brilliance under pressure that got rightfully integrated in the cricketing folklore. Results in the apex event, however, have not translated to the level of competitiveness associated with an India-Pakistan clash as India's 7-0 lead hardly does justice. Sustained political tension has denied fans from seeing the two neighbouring countries play a bilateral series since 2011-12. Pakistan last toured India in 2016 for the T20 World Cup and, therefore, there could be no better stage to make up for the vacuum than the world's biggest cricket venue: the 132,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium. The organisers of the recently concluded Asia Cup had tweaked the tournament rules to have a reserve day for the India-Pakistan Super Four fixture. While that decision garnered criticism, the reasoning behind it is understandable. And regardless of how amusing it may seem, it is no surprise that traveling fans have resorted to checking in at hospitals near the Ahmedabad stadium to find reasonable lodging since hotel prices have shot up by 20 times ahead of the blockbuster match. In World Cups or otherwise, India-Pakistan matches have rarely failed to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The stage is thus set for stars to achieve legendary status, for unlikely heroes to emerge as household names, or suffer the worst case of being the villain; for any ball bowled, any run scored possesses the potential to forever be etched in one's memory. Their timeless rivalry has, indeed, aged like fine wine. No matter who comes out victorious on the day, the sport itself will be the winner as yet another compelling contest awaits. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Mahmud had not served in that role since the India series in December last year. """"Since this is a home series, everyone will be here, so, I don't really want to [return to the role],"""" Mahmud had told the media before the England series this year. However, the recent issues including the Tamim Iqbal retirement saga, have seen the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) feel the urgency for maintaining clear communications between players and the BCB hierarchy. According to BCB sources, Mahmud will now be """"with the team as an observer in the upcoming Asia Cup"""". It was also learned that if things go well, he may even return as the team director in the World Cup in India. Mahmud yesterday attended the Tigers' practice session at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur. He was seen overseeing spinners in a net session while also discussing things with the Tigers' coaching staff. During Hathurusingha's previous stint, Mahmud worked as the team manager. Meanwhile, the Asia Cup standbys and the probable players for the New Zealand series in September also came to the ground yesterday after the national team's practice ended. A group of nine players, including Tamim Iqbal, are being kept prepared under a separate program with the World Cup in mind. The idea, as per the BCB officials, came from the head coach. Tamim yesterday batted in a training session for the first time in 46 days since that first ODI against Afghanistan. Mahmudullah Riyad skipped the session due to family emergency.

The match is slated to begin at 2:30 PM (Bangladesh Time). On one hand, whether spin or pace holds sway at the venue is still not discernible. India spin trio dominated against Australia in the hosts' World Cup opener and despite managing a below-par score, Australia's pacers created lots of problem for India's top-order in the evening. On the other hand, Tigers' pacers have not been able to sink their teeth into the conditions that were present in Dharmasala and would be hoping to turn things around at Chennai.

"Shanaka ruled out of World Cup with injury | The Daily Star","""Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka has been ruled out of the rest of the ICC ODI World Cup 2023 with a quad injury, ICC said in a press release today. The all-rounder has been replaced in the squad by Chamika Karunaratne, who was travelling with the Sri Lanka squad as a reserve player. Shanaka injured his right thigh muscle during Sri Lanka's match against Pakistan on Tuesday. The 32-year-old was later taken for scans which revealed that it will take him a minimum of three weeks to recover. Shanaka's injury is a big blow for Sri Lanka, who are already in a tough spot after losing their first two matches in the tournament.

"Kane Williamson's WC hopes in doubt with fractured thumb | The Daily Star","""New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been ruled out of the team's immediate World Cup matches with a fractured thumb, but head coach Gary Stead is optimistic the batter will be back in action at some stage of the tournament. After spending nearly seven months on the sidelines with a knee injury, Williamson made 78 not out in his return to action in the team's comprehensive victory against Bangladesh on Friday. The 33-year-old, however, was struck by a throw while running between the wickets during the match, which now makes him uncertain for the tournament. Tom Blundell will travel to India as cover, but Williamson will remain with the team with the hope of being available for the back end of group play next month, New Zealand Cricket said in a statement on Saturday. """"Firstly, we're all feeling for Kane to have this occur after all his hard work to return from his knee injury,"""" Stead said. """"While it's disappointing news, the initial diagnosis has given us some optimism he can still feature later in the pool play following a period of rest and rehabilitation.

"Conway puts New Zealand on top | The Daily Star","""Devon Conway's blistering 78 helped hosts New Zealand race to 155-2 against Sri Lanka at the end of a rain-delayed opening day of the second Test on Friday in Wellington. Conway fell short of a hundred as he was caught and bowled by Dhananjaya de Silva, who dived low to his right to get both hands on a superb catch, to end a thrilling 108-ball knock. First-Test hero Kane Williamson was unbeaten on 26 alongside Henry Nicholls on 18 when bad light stopped play at the Basin Reserve after Sri Lanka won the toss and put New Zealand in to bat in blustery conditions.

New Zealand started strong, with Conway and Tom Latham putting on an opening partnership of 87, after the 2,500th Test match in cricket history was hit by a damp start. Heavy overnight rain delayed the toss until after lunch. Latham fell for 21 around the halfway point of the day's curtailed proceedings when he spooned a Kasun Rajitha delivery to deep square, into the hands of Prabath Jayasuriya. Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne opted to give his bowlers an early opportunity to use a green wicket to attack the New Zealand batters. Conway responded by smashing 13 fours in a fiery knock.

"Ponting believes Australia will bounce back against South Africa | Australia v South Africa | The Daily Star","""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has faith in the depth of his former side and believes they will quickly bounce back from the loss in their opening match and put their campaign at the ongoing ICC ODI World Cup back on track. Australia lost against India by six wickets in Chennai on Sunday in their opening game of the 10-team tournament, where the Indian spinners proved too much to handle for the Aussies. Ponting wasn't impressed by the performance of the Pat Cummins-led team in the first match and said they need to bounce back in their next match, which will be against South Africa in Lucknow on Thursday. The Proteas posted the highest ever World Cup total ever, 428-5, in their opening match against Sri Lanka and won by 102 runs. Still, Ponting believes that the Australians have enough talent in their squad to stop the momentum of the high-flying South Africans and open their account in the competition. """"Australia, to me, looked to be a fair way off the mark, to be honest, in that game against India,"""" Ponting said on a recent episode of The ICC Review podcast. """"You can't afford to be zip-and-two [0-2] in a World Cup. We know how important it is to finish up the top of the table. But I've still got full faith in their squad.

But the wrist spinner didn't really make an impression on spin-friendly conditions in Chennai, going wicketless while conceding 53 runs off eight overs. Zampa is the only full-time spinner in the Australia squad after off-spinner Ashton Agar got ruled out of the tournament due to injury. So, for Aussies to do well, Ponting feels that Zampa needs to fire. """"They're going to need Adam Zampa bowling well. It's as simple as that,"""" Ponting said.

"Bangladesh Cricket: NZ win by nine wickets, series 2-0","""New Zealand batsmen made short work of the 109-run target in their second innings as they romped home in 18.4 overs against Bangladesh in the second Test at Hagley Oval, Christchurch today. Black Caps openers Jeet Raval and Tom Latham began positively and the 56-run partnership in 12.3 overs made sure the match didn’t go to the fifth and final day. Jeet was dismissed for 33 in 40 balls by Kamrul Islam Rabbi. However, Colin de Grandhomme hammered 33 in 14 balls with four huge sixes to take his side home emphatically. Kamrul bowled three overs for 21 runs for the wicket of Jeet. Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 173 in the second innings on the fourth day. The spectacular collapse left the home side with a chance to pull off an easy win even before going into the fifth and final day. They needed 109 runs in a possible 19 overs to complete a series sweep. Bangladesh were in absolute mess when they were reduced to 115-8 shortly after the tea break before a ninth wicket stand of 51 runs between Taskin Ahmed and Kamrul Islam extended the inexplicable innings a bit. It was the highest stand in the innings and Taskin Ahmed scored an enterprising 33 off 30 balls that contained a huge six. Kamrul remain unbeaten on 25. Bangladesh slipped to 100 for five at tea after Sabbir Rahman fended a rising ball from Neil Wagner to wicketkeeper BJ Watling for duck. When they returned after the break they lost wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan for a two-ball duck. Mehedi Hasan soon followed scoring a nervous four. Opener Soumya Sarker departed for 36 off 64 balls offering a catch at gully, where Jeet Raval took it spectacularly. It ended a 41-run second-wicket stand that also involved Mahmudullah, who dragged one on to his stump after scoring a compact 38. Shakib Al Hasan came and departed after playing some senseless shots. His first shot off Colin de Grandhomme went between the slips for four. He charged down the wicket off the second ball he faced and edged it to the second slip where Raval dropped him. The left-hander then chanced his arms against a packed off-side field against Tim Southee and was caught at backward point for seven-ball 8. It was Southee’s 200th wicket. Mahmudullah was playing well before dragging the ball on to the stumps after scoring 38 as Bangladesh were reduced to 92-4. There was more misery for the visitors as Sabbir Rahman's painful 11-ball stay was brought to an end by a rising delivery outside the off stump which the batsman poked to the slips. At a pace the wickets have been falling, there is a chance of a four-day finish of the game. Tamim Iqbal fell for eight runs as Bangladesh reached 20 for one at lunch. The Bangladesh skipper tried to pull a bouncer off Tim Southee, off the sixth over of the innings, only to find Mitchell Santner at deep square leg as the visitors were in early trouble after conceding a 65-run lead in the first innings. The first innings of the home team ended at 354 when Neil Wagner was run out in a peculiar fashion. He ran for a comfortable second, but he didn't drag his bat and was airborne when wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan flicked the ball into the stumps. The decision was made by the third umpire. Henry Nicholls gave New Zealand a considerable first-innings lead but the left-hander got out on 98, dragging off-spinner Mehedi Hasan Miraz on to his stumps shortly after the first drinks break. But by the time he was dismissed he put on a valuable 57 runs for the ninth wicket with Wagner. Shakib Al Hasan struck in sixth over of the fourth morning when he had Tim Southee caught at cover by Mehedi Hasain for 17. The Black Caps, resuming the day on 260-7 after a no show on the third day due to rain, started briskly hitting a boundary in every over before Southee got out. It was Shakib’s fourth wicket after his three off nine deliveries deep into the final session on the second day. Mehedi made some amends for his earlier blunder by holding onto the catch. He dropped Southee in the second slip off Kamurul Islam Rabbi when the batsman was on 15. The catching was once again very poor. Nazmul Hossain dropped Wagner off Taskin Ahmed when he was on 7. The home side however quickly wiped out the deficit with Nicholls in full flow after resuming on 56. Bangladesh took the second new ball after 80 overs. The game started half an hour behind the schedule due to a wet patch on the pitch.

"All to do for Tigers after rain | The Daily Star","""Bangladesh will go into the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand today keeping in mind that they cannot repeat the same mistake they committed in the first Test which they surrendered spectacularly after dominating for four days. Bangladesh will take the field with an expressed intention of mopping up the Black Caps tail as quickly as possible. The home side on the other hand will resume on 260 for seven and will try to overtake Bangladesh's first-innings total of 289. If they can take a considerable lead, they will be in a better position to pounce on the Tigers. However, after a no-show on the third day, which was washed out without a single ball being bowled due to rain, the onus will be on the Tigers to apply themselves on what would be a slightly disconcerting wicket on a damp Hagley Oval ground. It is understood that Bangladesh will have to bat for most part of the day. And if they can correct the mistakes they committed in their second innings of the first Test when they were bowled out for 160 after scoring a massive 595 in their first essay, they will be able to put the pressure back on the home team. In that event the first two sessions will be extremely crucial. The winners of the two sessions will decide which way the game will be heading on the fifth and final day. Bangladesh as a bowling unit did a commanding job on the second day. But it is the batting that has not been consistent and more importantly some key players like opener Tamim Iqbal and middle-order batsman Mahmudullah Riyad have not been among the runs. The absence of injured captain Mushfiqur Rahim was felt keenly throughout the limited-overs series and will doubtless be felt here. But the most heartening aspect in the second Test so far is that the Tigers have produced their best in extreme adversity and fought well without their three key batsmen -- opener Imrul Kayes, one-down Mominul Haque and Mushfiqur all missed the game due to injury. The inexperienced pace attack performed beyond expectation. Bangladesh might have suffered six straight defeats in the limited-overs series, they lost the opening Test by seven wickets at Wellington in an inexplicable way. But they are still possibly two days away to turn a tour of missed opportunities into an unforgettable end. And if they can show that resolve in batting they will surely be in a position to leave down under with a big smile on their face. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"'Will be a test of character for NZ' | The Daily Star","""A washout on the third day of the second Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand in Christchurch suppressed, to a certain extent, the excitement that was created after Shakib Al Hasan took three quick wickets late on Day Two and evened out the game. However, with the wicket behaving as it is, both teams reckon that there is a good chance of a result if the rains do not interrupt the Test further. The first two days of the Test saw 17 wickets fall and with the wicket expected to keep offering help to the bowlers, it seems the game will tilt towards the side that can put in a better batting performance towards the end. With the rain lashing onto the covers at the Hagley Oval almost throughout the day yesterday, it could mean that the Bangladesh batsmen might have to face a more difficult time once they manage to grab the last three wickets and go to bat. Bangladesh wicketkeeper-batsman, Nurul Hasan has said that Bangladesh will first be looking to confirm a draw before thinking about a win. “It's difficult to say what will happen. A lot will depend on the start of the game tomorrow. But no matter what happens, we have to stay positive. We have to think about confirming a draw first and then if there is a chance, we will try to take that chance and win as well,” explained Nurul. “There are still two more days and who knows, anything is possible, anything can happen,” he added. Former Bangladesh national coach and current bowling coach of New Zealand, Shane Jurgensen, echoed the sentiment and reckons that a result was very much possible in the two 'long days' that are remaining. “I think there is still a lot of time left in the game. I suppose we just need a few good partnerships and once the sun comes out tomorrow we can set up. We have two long days to go,” said Jurgensen. “I think it [ the wicket] will certainly offer a little bit [because of the rain] when the sun comes out tomorrow. It has been a good wicket throughout the summer, but it may offer something initially. Can't really predict too much,” Jurgensen , adding that spin might come into play at Christchurch towards the latter stages of the game. While New Zealand dominated most of the second day, they lost three wickets to Shakib shortly before play was called off because of a drizzle making the turf slippery and gave up the advantage. It was something that Jurgensen was disappointed about. “I think we certainly didn't execute our plans. Bangladesh are a very positive team. I have been there myself. When you don't get something right, they will be positive and go against you,” said Jurgensen. Furthermore, Jurgensen urged his batsmen to be wary of Shakib on Day Four and advised them to tuck him around for singles rather than looking to hit him for boundaries. “I think it's going to be a real test of character for the team to try and get as many runs as we can and set up and see how the game pans out,” said Jurgensen. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"'Still have work to do' | The Daily Star","""Shakib Al Hasan's three wickets towards the end of the day yesterday gave the Bangladesh team a reason to smile. The Bangladesh bowlers worked hard yesterday at Christchurch, but they just were not getting the rewards. There were a few chances that were not taken on the field and a decision did not go their way as well. Right before tea, it seemed as though the hosts were on their way to taking a huge lead. However, the three wickets from Shakib helped the visitors come back into the game. Bangladesh pacer Taskin Ahmed, who bowled a beautiful opening spell yesterday, believes that the Tigers have a good chance of even winning the game. “We have taken seven New Zealand wickets. We are not entirely pleased since we have some work left in the innings. We will try to bowl them out early. I think our batsmen also have to give us a big score in the second innings. “We have won from such positions in the past. If we do our best we can win even in away conditions,” said Taskin during the post-day press conference yesterday. Playing just his second Test, Taskin believed that the pacers performed quite well yesterday and managed to utilise the conditions. “All the bowlers contributed in different ways. Some bowled good spells and some took wickets while some checked the run-making. We bowled in the right areas, but we have to finish it better,” said Taskin. “All three pace bowlers did well. Rubel and I are fast bowlers so we could be aggressive. We could swing the ball with pace. We bowled according to plan,” he added. He believes that the momentum on a sporting wicket has shifted towards Bangladesh because of Shakib's spell at the end. Unlike the wicket in Wellington, the track in Christchurch is likely to assist the bowlers as the Test progresses. As such, the third day will be quite crucial for the result of this game. Going by Bangladesh's poor record in the second innings of a Test, a lot could depend on how much New Zealand score in their first innings. At the moment New Zealand are 29 runs behind with a set Henry Nicholls at the crease. Bangladesh's highest total in the third or fourth innings of a Test away from home is 382, which they scored in Lord's back in 2010. It was a score they managed to reach courtesy of Tamim Iqbal's century. Against New Zealand, they scored 282 while chasing 404 at Hamilton in 2010. Shakib Al Hasan scored a Test hundred back then. It is obvious that the Tigers will need a batsman to bat throughout if they want to have any chances of winning this Test. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket: Rain washouts Day 3","""Rain washed out the third day’s play of the second and final Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand at the Hagley Oval today. It was a very frustrating day as rain poured in from the morning and did not stop when umpires Paul Reiffel and Nigel Llong had the final inspection at 4pm and called off the game for the day. Weather permitting the game will resume at 10.30am tomorrow, half an hour ahead of the scheduled play, with New Zealand at 260-7, chasing Bangladesh’s first innings total of 289. “We still have two more days and I think there is a chance for us to get a positive result. We can’t do anything about rain. What we want to do is to be focused in the next two days,” said debutant wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan while talking to the reporters after the postponement decision. The day was even frustrating for the Tiger because they had to stay at the ground for seven hours. The lucky ones were of course the Black Caps who did not even bother to turn up at the venue. Bangladesh arrived at the venue at 9 am after that unpleasant experience on the third day of the opening Test at Wellington. They stayed at the hotel a bit longer due of drizzle and they thought that there would be a delayed start. But by the time they turned up to Basin Reserve, a venue with first-class drainage facility, they were almost running behind the schedule to get ready for the game. But if that was a scary experience, today’s one was very boring for the players since they were not allowed to leave the ground until that final decision from the umpires – a standard procedure that ICC match referee Javagal Srinath religiously followed. Since it rained quite heavily for most part of seven hours the players spent time sitting in the dressing room, having fun among them.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"It's going to be a good Test: Latham | The Daily Star","""New Zealand opener Tom Latham believes that the second Test, like the first one in Wellington, is likely to have an exciting finish with both teams looking good. Speaking to reporters after the second day yesterday, Latham said that the wicket at Christchurch would eventually deteriorate and that the spinners could come into play. “I think the Test match is pretty even. The first hour tomorrow morning is going to be crucial for both teams, we've got Henry Nicholls in there on 50-odd and batting really nice. If we can build some partnerships with the tail hopefully we can swing the momentum back in our favour. “There's still a bit of movement for the bowlers and it tended to swing more than Wellington. It quickened up from yesterday [day one] and might take bit of turn towards the end. Looks like the Test is going to be a good one,” said Latham. The Black Caps were in trouble early when a burst from Kamrul Islam Rabbi removed both Jeet Raval and Kane Williamson in a single over. That is when Latham and Ross Taylor got together to rebuild the innings for the hosts with a 127-run stand for the third wicket. While Latham scored 68, Taylor ended up scoring 77. Latham later on explained that it was quite difficult for them to score runs with the Bangladeshis bowling a good line. The New Zealand top order batsman in fact were beaten a number of times due to the pace and swing. “At a critical time we lost two quick wickets before lunch. They didn't really give us anything to hit and we struggled to rotate the strike. For us to get through that tough time and put pressure back on them after lunch was good,” said Latham. He admitted that the three late wickets in the day took away a bit of the momentum from them. Latham however hopes they can take a good enough lead and put the pressure back on the Bangladeshis. “It's pretty even with those three late wickets. It gave them a bit of momentum but if we can come in the morning get a few with the ball it'll swing it back into our favour. “If we can get ourselves in a handy position and get as many as we can in front hopefully we can put the pressure on them with the ball,” said Latham. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Cricket: Nineties nothing new to Kane Williamson","""Black Caps skipper Kane Williamson has many New Zealand batting records in his sights but most scores in the nineties would have to be one of the most unique. Williamson finished on 95 not out against Bangladesh at Nelson's Saxton Oval yesterday, the seventh time he has ended an ODI innings in the nineties, reports nzherald.co.nz Williamson has scored eight one-day centuries in his career putting him fourth on the New Zealand all-time list but he now sits in second for scores in the nineties. It seemed to be a 2015 issue for Williamson, who was out in the nineties five times that year and it took until the final day of 2016 for it to happen again. Nathan Astle holds the record with nine scores of his 41 fifties finishing in the nineties, two of which were not out. Yesterday's innings was the first time Williamson has been not out just short of a century. He's also been out three times in the nineties in tests, although has 15 tons to his name. Surprisingly Ross Taylor, who sits just behind Astle with 15 ODI tons, has been out in the nineties just twice in 162 innings. While Martin Crowe is at the other end of the 90s-to-100s conversion rate with six scores in the nineties compared to four centuries. Like Taylor, Brendon McCullum was also rarely out in the nineties, happening just once in his 228 ODI innings.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Cricket: Australia double up on spin as Misbah ponders","""Australia have one eye on India and Pakistan could be contemplating life without their most successful captain Misbah-ul-Haq when the final 'dead' Test begins on Tuesday in Sydney. Steve Smith's Australians wrapped up the three-match series with a Test to spare in a dramatic second innings demolition of Pakistan in two sessions in Melbourne on Friday to open up new selection possibilities for Sydney. Shattered Pakistan could be forced to look for a new leader with 42-year-old Misbah admitting he was thinking about retirement, possibly even before the series concludes in Sydney. """"I always believed that if I couldn't contribute to the team then it's no point staying there. I haven't decided (about Sydney) but let's see,"""" Misbah said after the tourists lost by an innings and 18 runs. While the end looms for the man who has guided his country to more victories than any other Pakistan captain -- 24 in 52 Tests -- Australia have other considerations. Spinners Steve O'Keefe and Ashton Agar have been included in a 13-man squad for a Sydney Cricket Ground wicket that is expected to turn. Coach Darren Lehmann raised the prospect of playing two of his three spin options -- the other is Australia's most-successful off-spinner Nathan Lyon -- at the expense of paceman Jackson Bird with an all-rounder coming in. Australia go to India for four Tests in February and March on likely turning pitches, putting the onus of O'Keefe and Agar to put in a good audition and stake a claim for a place on tour. """"It's more than likely that we're going to play two of those three spinners which means we'll also have to look to fit in an all-rounder,"""" Lehmann said. """"It might end up that someone like Jackson Bird could be the unlucky one who misses out, but that will depend on the condition of the SCG pitch. """"If it looks like it's going to provide more assistance for the seamers, then we still have the option of playing all three specialist quicks and just the one spinner."""" The all-rounder option could rest between Zimbabwe-born Hilton Cartwright or Agar, who Lehmann puts in the versatile category, saying """"he's certainly got the talent to be a batting all-rounder or a spinning all-rounder"""". Left-arm spinner Agar, 23, is on track to play for the first time since his only two Tests on the 2013 Ashes tour of England, where he scored 98 on debut at Trent Bridge batting at number 11. Agar has subsequently scored two first-class hundreds and eight fifties. Pakistan are facing their 12th straight defeat since their last Test win in Australia in Sydney 22 years ago. Misbah was disconsolate following the Melbourne second-innings debacle on good batting surface that had seen the teams score a total of 1,067 first-innings runs. """"After scoring 443 you should not be in that position to lose a Test match on the last day,"""" Misbah said.

"Cricket: PCB to sue BCCI for unplayed Test series","""Pakistan cricket chiefs have said they will sue India for failing to honour a 2014 deal to play a bilateral Test series. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) signed an agreement under which the South Asian rivals were due to play six series between 2015 and 2023, subject to clearance from the Indian government. There has been no Test cricket between the two nations since 2007. Bilateral cricket ties were severed in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Under the agreement India was to tour Pakistan in 2015, with Pakistan visiting its neighbour in 2017. But the BCCI backed out from playing Pakistan -- even in a neutral venue -- saying New Delhi would not allow it amid strained relations. """"Two series have been defaulted,"""" said PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan. """"We will write to BCCI and if they don't respond then we will take the legal course as we demand compensation."""" The PCB's executive committee chairman Najam Sethi said Pakistan was missing out financially, losing up to $200 million on four of the six series it was meant to host.

"A stride in the right direction | The Daily Star","""Since acquiring the ODI status and stepping into the international scene in 2011, Bangladesh women's team had their crowning achievement with the 2018 Asia Cup victory. To still be the only team to break India's monopoly in the prestigious continental event remains a monumental feat, also considering that the men's team are yet to taste such success. Although Bangladesh women found stable ground, they were found wanting in the three subsequent T20 World Cups -- as evidenced by their winless streak in the marquee events. Their maiden appearance at the ODI World Cup last year, however, brought a sense of renewed promise. A win against Pakistan and two closely contested affairs over two big guns -- West Indies and South Africa -- allowed the Tigresses to make their presence felt at the global stage. However, with the Asia Cup triumph far in the past, the women cricketers longed to come up with a breakthrough performance. The recently concluded white-ball series against India at home presented a glorious opportunity for the Tigresses to prove a point or two in front of their fans. Across three T20Is and as many ODIs, there were a lot of boxes ticked in Bangladesh women's favour, ones that have the necessary advertising ingredients to rally up the cricket-crazy fans who rarely fail to show up in numbers whenever the men's team play an international match. In their first-ever home series, the Tigresses showed they can fight neck and neck with India, who were not meant to be intimidated by the playing conditions here. Surpassing expectations of a one-off victory indicated the women in red and green have come of age. Overall, Bangladesh's spirited performance, their attitude in victory and defeat was in stark contrast to how India captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, tainted the spirit of the game with her antics in the final fixture that culminated in a thrilling tie. The icing on the cake for Bangladesh arrived with stellar individual displays. In pacer Marufa Akter, whose pumping action complements her inspirational backstory, the country has found another superstar in the making. A clip of her boundary-saving effort in the field had gone viral, and a brilliantly executed in-swinger to bowl out India opener, Priya Punia, in the second ODI had captured the imagination of audiences. Moreover, the country's leading international run-scorer, Fargana Haque Pinky, entered the record books by being the first Bangladeshi woman to score an ODI century. Marufa and Pinky – who alongside spinner Nahida Akter broke into the top 20's in ICC rankings in their respective fields -- had therefore made the impact needed to break some inertia of fan-following and media coverage. The Bangladesh captain aptly expressed the key takeaway from the series. """"I think we have taken a respectable step forward after this series. There were many who didn't know us, apart from one or two players. At least those people now recognise who Nahida, Pinky or Marufa are. So, I think this is an achievement since the people of Bangladesh now know who plays in the women's team,"""" said Nigar Sultana Joty. The cricketers have played their cards to the best of their abilities and for the Tigresses, irrespective of whatever outcome may be in store in the foreseeable future, the stage is set for their next phase of evolution. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) can be presumed to be well aware of the to-dos in this regard: for starters, ensuring that the domestic circuit rolls on at the highest-possible level. As the global women's sport continues its successful march to a much-increased viewership and wage structure in place, it remains to be seen how long it takes before the cricketers see the gender pay gap eliminated and get to entertain a full house. In reality, however, the latter is a precursor to the former. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Fargana patiently accepted and posed for a few snaps, absorbing all the limelight that the right-handed batter rightfully has been getting since registering the maiden hundred for Bangladesh in Women's ODIs in the third of the three-match series against India in Mirpur on Saturday. With the final game tied, Bangladesh shared the series with India – the best outcome for the Tigresses against strong India. Understandably, the environment inside the team hotel yesterday was something the Bangladesh women cricketers have rarely experienced before. Asked how it felt, Fargana replied: """"It's a different experience. Everyone [the media and the BCB officials] came here and I am enjoying this. It seems our importance has increased massively."""" Fargana's assumption was correct as the women cricketers in Bangladesh last received such adulation when they clinched the Asia Cup in 2018.

Everyone is praising me, encouraging me and they told me that I have to play even better in the coming days,"""" said Marufa, who shone brightly in the ODI series with seven wickets in three games. Despite the cash prize, the BCB boss admitted that the board has been unable to provide enough support and facilities that the women's team deserved. He also promised to put more emphasis on this regard in the coming days. """"We gave them a bonus but the more important fact is that we are willing to give more focus on them. They gave us some suggestions and we assured them we would look into it. They need support staff along with coaches. They have asked for a pace bowling coach and we have decided to fulfill those,"""" said Papon. Papon also pointed out a few areas in order to develop women's cricket in Bangladesh from the root level. He talked about introducing school cricket and also announced to start of the women's BPL. """"We also want to have school cricket for the girls and we are willing to start it this year which will help us to get new players. They [players] have also asked to introduce the women's BPL and we assured them that we have already taken a decision in principle to start that,"""" Papon added.

"From being taunted to being admired | The Daily Star","""Marufa Akter has emerged as the new sensation in Bangladesh women's cricket team. The youngster from Nilphamari was instrumental behind the Tigresses' maiden ODI win against India, picking up four wickets in the opening match of the three-match series recently. The 18-year-old pacer then held her nerve to defend three runs in the final over in the final ODI as Bangladesh tied the game and drew the series 1-1. Marufa spoke in detail to The Daily Star's Mazhar Uddin, opening up about her bowling, life, future plans among many other topics during an exclusive interview, the excerpts of which are as follows: The Daily Star (DS): Did you set any target for yourself before the series against India? Marufa Akter (MA): To be honest, it was always my dream to play at the Sher-e-Bangla National stadium in Mirpur, and before the start of the series I said to myself that if I got the opportunity I would give my best. I actually didn't see the names or faces of the opposition players as it was a game of bat and ball. I tried to maintain my line and length and all went well. DS: Did any of your relatives go there to watch the games? MA: Yes, my brother went to watch the game all the way from Nilphamari. He watched all the matches from the gallery. DS: How did it feel playing in front of a family member? MA: I can't tell you how it felt, it was probably one of the best moments of my life. When you play and you get to see your brother watching you play from the stands, that too after travelling a long way, it is something I feel great about. DS: What is the reaction in your hometown? Do other girls want to become a cricketer like you? MA: To be honest there are not many girls in my village who would want to be a cricketer as most of those of my age have got married already. DS: But the interest must have grown after seeing you play like this? MA: Maybe, but I don't know to be honest. DS: Let's hear about your bowling. MA: When I started off, it was all natural. Maybe it was not at the best of shapes but as things progressed, I started to work on various aspects of my bowling. My coaches helped me a lot and day by day my pace has increased while the line and length have improved. I also had the urge to reach the top and followed the instructions of my coaches. DS: You picked up four wickets in Bangladesh's maiden ODI win against India. Tell us about that game. MA: I always wanted to do something for my country and was eager to contribute to my team's success. I was backed by my captain [Nigar Sultana] Joty apu as she always encouraged me by saying that I am the best bowler in the team. She also told me to just maintain my line and length as she felt the opposition won't be able to play me properly. I felt the same too. I bowled according to the line and length and it worked. DS: What was going through your mind when you had three runs to defend in the final over in the third ODI? MA: Once again Joty apu came to me and told me to keep belief in yourself. When they got two runs off the first two balls, I felt that I shouldn't get nervous, instead the batters should get nervous. DS: Who do you follow as a bowler? MA: I follow Hardik Pandya. In Bangladesh, I follow Mustafizur Rahman bhai. Many say that I am the female Mustafizur (smiles). DS: Where do you want to see yourself from now? MA: My target is to play in foreign leagues such as IPL, Big Bash, CPL. Hope that I can perform for Bangladesh and give my best. DS: You have become a big star in Bangladesh cricket at a very young age. What would be your message to young girls who want to play cricket? MA: There will be hurdles from family and society. The desire must come from within yourself, and if you have the urge to become something, you have to work hard for it. I faced a lot of hurdles in my life but I was able to overcome those. People used to taunt me when I started playing since I was the only girl from my area playing cricket. But now when I go to my village, people come to see me and it feels good. People now tell my mother that they never imagined that her daughter would reach the top. DS: Who is your best friend in the national team? MA: Most of my teammates are senior to me. Shorna [Akter] apu is the youngest among them. So the two of us have a lot of fun together. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Tigers want to move on | The Daily Star","""Bangladesh team on Wednesday departed for India's Guwahati to play the ICC Cricket World Cup, hoping to put behind the drama that has unfolded back home following the exclusion of veteran opener Tamim Iqbal from the India-bound squad. BCB's lateness in announcing the World Cup squad added to the drama, in fact made more room for it while the midnight meeting between coach Chandika Hathurusingha, skipper Shakib Al Hasan and BCB president Nazmul Hassan added more speculation to the already hyped-up atmosphere. A BCB source told The Daily Star on Tuesday morning, on the very day of the squad announcement that Shakib had communicated to the board that he would not captain the team at the World Cup if there were unfit players in the squad. Following the squad announcement, where Tamim was dropped, plenty of criticism followed. The team also departed for India on the back of a 2-0 series loss against New Zealand at home. Team director Khaled Mahmud, prior to the team's departure for India, told media that what had transpired the day before needed to be left behind. """"The team is going today and I believe the boys will be upbeat. We know we haven't performed well in the New Zealand series and many of the main players from both sides didn't play. But World Cup is a different stage and we are getting some time ahead of the World Cup and we have two practice matches to sort ourselves [before the tournament],"""" Mahmud told reporters at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. """"What has happened, there is nothing to do about it anymore. We have to look forward to tomorrow and that's the hope we are harbouring,"""" he said. """"I feel that the dream is certainly alive in the eyes of these 15 [in the squad]. It's important to fulfil that dream. That's why not only the cricketers, but everyone, including the support staff, must be aligned together under one thread,"""" Mahmud added. With many young players like Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Tanzim Hasan Sakib in the squad, Mahmud urged everyone to keep faith in them. """"Many will say that the young boys are going; youngsters but they have the ability to do well and so they are going there.

"Shakib blames Tamim for series defeat against Afghanistan | The Daily Star","""Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan blamed former ODI skipper Tamim Iqbal for the ODI series defeat at home against Afghanistan earlier this year. The all-rounder, during the second part of his interview with T Sports, said that he saw for the first time in his life that a captain announced his retirement after playing the first game of a series. """"I will completely blame the captain for our series loss against Afghanistan. I didn't see anywhere in the world a captain after playing the first game of a series coming in and emotionally saying I will not play cricket anymore. I've seen something like this for the first time in my life"""" said Shakib. Tamim had announced his shock retirement from all forms of international cricket after playing the first ODI of the three-match series in Chattogram and then unretired after a day following a meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Bangladesh lost that series 2-1, with the only victory coming in the third match. """"A responsible captain can never do something like this,"""" said Shakib, adding that they were still recovering from that setback. When asked about his team's strength and weakness in the World Cup squad, the Bangladesh skipper said that he will only miss the service of injured pacer Ebadot Hossain. """"Ebadot is my biggest loss in the World Cup and except his absence there is no weakness in my team,"""" said Shakib.

The Shakib-Tamim saga took all the limelight in Bangladesh's build-up to the World Cup. The coach's comments regarding Bangladesh's chances and expectations in the World Cup also raised a few question marks after he had said that 'those who were dreaming of seeing Bangladesh win the World Cup should wake up'. In the pre-match press conference on Friday, the Sri Lankan cleared the air regarding that interview, saying: """"My job is to take the pressure off the players."""" Talking about the team's expectations in the tournament, Hathurusingha reiterated, like in that interview, that semifinals would be their first realistic target.

"Shakib, Hridoy fifties help Tigers post 265 against India | The Daily Star","""Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan and in-form batter Towhid Hridoy hit fifties as the tigers posted 265 for eight in their Asia Cup Super Four contest against India at the R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday. Shakib missed out on his 10th ODI ton as he departed after scoring a well-made 85-ball80 laced with six fours and three sixes, while Hridoy had to grind it out in the middle to score an 81-ball 54. India's Shardul Thakur was the pick of the bowlers as he picked up three wickets for 65 runs, while Mohammad Shami chipped in with two scalps. Bangladesh were sent into bat after India skipper Rohit Sharma won the toss. Opener Liton Das's poor form continued as he was dismissed for a duck in the third over of the innings as he had little clue about Mohammad Shami's in-swinger that nipped in after pitching outside off as the ball zipped past the defense and crashed onto the stumps. One brought two for India as an over later, Liton's partner Tanzid Tamim had to go back to the hut. Tamim, who was left out after the Tigers' first game against Sri Lanka in the ongoing edition of the tournament, couldn't make his second shot at opening the innings count as he played one onto the stumps while trying to pull a short-of-a-good-length delivery bowled by India pacer Shardul Thakur in the fourth over. He looked good for his 12-ball 13 as he put away three boundaries but failed to capitalise on his start. Things looked ominous for the Tigers when number three batter Anamul Haque Bijoy threw his wicket away in a manner that made many scratch their heads. In the fourth over, Anamul pulled Shardul for a boundary in the second delivery of the sixth over. The next ball was a yorker that he fended after which he looked to pull across a good-length delivery outside off-stump but failed to get anywhere near to make proper contact. All he could do is concede a top-dge that scooped up and fell into the hands of wicketkeeper KL Rahul. His lacklustre knock lasted for 11 balls off which he managed four runs that came from a solitary boundary. Mehedi Hasan Miraz was asked to come at number five today and the right-handed batter struggled to get going. Having been dropped twice in an over, the 25-year-old failed to capitalise on his good fortune and could only manage a 28-ball 13 before poking at a regulation delivery outside off-stump bowled by left-arm spinner Axar Patel in the 14th over. It seemed Miraz was caught in two minds and ended up giving Rohit Sharma at slip a catching practice. This left the Tigers reeling at four down for 59 runs. With Bangladesh staring down the barrel of yet another dismal batting effort, skipper Shakib displayed some of his most decisive batsmanship to drag the Tigers out of imminent trouble. He played a series of commanding strokes to keep the score ticking while stitching a 101-run stand with Towhid Hridoy. Shakib came in to bat in the fourth over and hit five fours and a two sixes while bringing up his 55th ODI fifty in 65 deliveries when he hit left-arm spinner Axar Patel for a maximum in the 26th over. But the Drinks Break became the death of him as he played one onto the stumps in the first delivery of the 34th over bowled by seamer Shardul Thakur which was the first ball after the break. It appeared that Shakib suffered from a lapse in concentration as he played a half-hearted shot to leave Bangladesh reeling at five down for 160. Shamim's streak of having minimal impact on the Tigers collective performance continued. For the second straight occasion, he was dismissed in similar fashion when he went back to a regulation left-arm spin delivery bowled by Ravindra Jadeja and got trapped lbw in front after managing one run from five deliveries. Hridoy kept up the charge and reached his fifty with a boundary but soon fell to Shami when he tried to take on the pacer over square leg. The ball was there to be hit and Hridoy managed to get good bat on it but the elevation outweighed distance on that occasion and the ball fell into debutant Tilak Varma's hands at deep square leg. His dismissal left the Tigers at seven down for 193 and given the recent performances of their tail, the Tigers were in danger of being bundled out for yet another subpar score. But Nasum Ahmed, who is in the side for his bowling, refused to bend and led a counter-punch, scoring a 45-ball 44 laced with six fours and a six as he put together a 45-run stand for the eighth wicket with Sheikh Mahedi Hasan, who scored a 23-ball 29. Debutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib chipped in with an eight-ball 14-run cameo to help Bangladesh out of a bleak outlook adn post a total beyond 250.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"India crush Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in Asia Cup final | The Daily Star","""Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 6-21 to lead India's rout of Sri Lanka by 10 wickets as they clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday. Siraj got four wickets in one over to help skittle Sri Lanka out for 50, a total the Indian openers Ishan Kishan and Shubman Gill surpassed in 6.1 overs for an impressive victory ahead of next month's ODI World Cup at home. Sri Lanka's miserably low total in the 50-over contest left a nearly packed house disappointed after they witnessed just 116 minutes of play. The hosts elected to bat first following a delayed start due to rain and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah struck first with the wicket of Kusal Perera, caught behind for a duck in the first over. Siraj soon took over as he made the ball swing and seam in overcast conditions to easily surpass his previous ODI best of 4-32. He got Pathum Nissanka for two and then struck on successive balls to send back Sadeera Samarawickrama (0) and Charith Asalanka (0), but a hat-trick was averted. Dhananjaya de Silva hit a boundary but Siraj had him caught behind with the next ball, much to the delight of the Indian fans. Siraj got his fifth with the wicket of Sri Lankan captain Dasun Shanaka, equalling an ODI record for the fastest five-wicket haul from his first 16 balls of the match. Kusal Mendis hit three boundaries before becoming Siraj's sixth wicket, although Sri Lanka avoided the lowest-ever ODI total of 35 by Zimbabwe. After Virat Kohli's overthrow went for a boundary, and six more runs to the total, Sri Lanka pushed past their lowest ODI total of 43 scored against South Africa in 2012. Hardik Pandya took three wickets to wrap up the innings in just 90 minutes. Mendis' 17 and an unbeaten 13 by Dushan Hemantha were the only double-digit scores in an innings that featured five ducks. Shubman Gill, a centurion in the previous match, began with a boundary in the opening over on his way to an unbeaten 27 and fellow opener Ishan Kishan (23) soon joined the party. The left-handed Ishan smashed fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana for two successive boundaries, and three more in a row from Gill gave India victory in the tournament's shortest final. Rohit Sharma's India dropped just one match in the tournament after they lost an inconsequential Super Four contest against Bangladesh. Sri Lanka, who won the previous edition of the Asia Cup played in the T20 format, came in as underdogs and snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan but went down without a fight in their 11th final. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"India, Sri Lanka eye Asian crown | The Daily Star","""Rohit Sharma's India face underdogs Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final, a crucial momentum-builder heading into next month's ODI World Cup. The cricketing giants have 13 Asian titles between them and Sri Lanka have a history of sneaking into the tournament's final -- to the consternation of fans keen for any showdown between arch-rivals India and Pakistan. Bangladesh ended India's unbeaten run in the 50-over tournament after edging them out by six runs in Friday's last Super Four match. Shubman Gill hit 121 but his knock went in vain after India faltered in their chase of 266 in Colombo, where Sunday's final will also be held. """"I don't think it has broken our momentum,"""" Gill told reporters after the narrow defeat. """"We have played good cricket. Sometimes it happens on these wickets. I was set and should have finished off the game."""" Gill said clinching India's eighth Asia Cup title would give them """"confidence"""" ahead of the World Cup starting back home on October 5. India began with a washed-out match in Pallekele against Pakistan, whose fast bowlers rattled their top order and bowled them out for 266 in the only innings possible due to rain. Big guns Virat Kohli and returning batsman KL Rahul hit back with centuries in their next outing against Babar Azam's team to rack up 356-2 and crush Pakistan by 228 runs. India then prevented a gutsy Sri Lankan chase to book their place in the final, but Gill said their opponents were still a threat. """"We will have to pull up our socks and be at our 100 percent to beat them,"""" he said. Sri Lanka, who won the previous edition of the Asia Cup played in the T20 format, came in as underdogs and snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan. They soon got into their groove on home soil and, despite going down to India, edged out Pakistan in a knockout match for their 11th Asia Cup final. """"We came without our key players, but still we managed to make the finals,"""" skipper Dasun Shanaka said. Injuries sidelined Dushmantha Chameera and Wanindu Hasaranga, but others stood up at crucial junctures.

Up-and-coming fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana and left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage have impressed and lead the tournament's bowling chart with 11 and 10 wickets respectively. Wellalage rattled India's batting with five wickets including the prized scalps of Kohli and Rohit in their Super Four match.

"Shakib shows avenue for better batting plan | The Daily Star","""When Shakib Al Hasan came to the crease yesterday in the fourth over, the top-order was once again struggling; this time at 15 for two. Shakib may not have found the hundred he would have been desperate to get, but during a crucial 101-run stand with Tawhid Hridoy, he batted to a plan to bring much-needed respite for Bangladesh in their Asia Cup Super Four fixture against India in Colombo. After missing out on a single, the stump mic caught him telling Hridoy, """"You know how much further we have to go?"""" It was a reminder of the task ahead. And as the only veteran in the playing eleven, it was much needed. Judging from his remarks before the game, he was acutely asking his players to take up their end of the bargain. He demonstrated how he does his bit. """"Here experience or inexperience or new and old doesn't come into the equation,"""" he had said. It was the scenario the Tigers' veterans and youngsters have to play if the team are to find rhythm at the upcoming World Cup. With Anamul Haque Bijoy once again failing to impress and Mehedi Miraz departing soon after, the Tigers' batting recovery hinged on Shakib and Hridoy's partnership. Shakib, was comfortable in shot-making from the onset but impatience was showing as well. He had to gradually settle down with wickets falling around him. It had been 36 innings since his last ODI ton; in fact, he has not reached three figures in any format since his blistering 124 not out against the Windies at the 2019 World Cup. But as he has shown many times, he often does not worry about the numbers as long as he is contributing. He has scored fifty 11 times, crossing 90 twice since that ton against Windies. The unbeaten 96 against Zimbabwe was the closest he got to a hundred since then. When he came on, it felt like he needed some luck on his side to play a bigger innings. He had got going against Pakistan in this Asia Cup too, but did not make enough to really make an impact. This time against India, despite it being a dead rubber, Shakib needed some confidence to carry to the World Cup. It is after all, his individual responsibility to shine with the bat at the World Cup. That rub of the green came in the 19th over, when off-spinner Tilak Varma troubled him and got the outside edge but only for KL Rahul to drop a difficult chance behind the stumps. Shakib would then get the wake-up call. With the spinners introduced, he found negotiating Varma difficult. But when India wanted to squeeze the run-rate, Shakib had finally found his preferred matchups in Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja. While risks could not assure favourable results with a lot of rebuilding to do, Shakib and Hridoy were calculative. Thus, Hridoy went after Varma, the right-arm off-spinner, hitting two sixes in the 23rd over. Shakib picked the cue for acceleration and hit Patel for two through mid-wicket. As spinners were trying to go through their overs fast, Shakib faced 20 deliveries from Patel, hitting 27 runs and picking 22 from the 17 deliveries he faced against Jadeja. Hridoy had taken Verma for 15 off the nine he faced against his favourable matchup. When it looked assured that Shakib would convert the 80 to a ton, he fell to a careless shot, at a time the team needed a bigger contribution from him. Hridoy's fifty would ensure at least 200 on the board before Nasum Ahmed and Mahedi Hasan finished well. Despite the lacklustre state of the batting department, some nuance shown by the skipper and others after yet another top-order struggle should set the Tigers on a better plan for their batting department. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Shaheen fires Pakistan's Shaheen Shah Afridi made an early statement when he rattled India with his left-arm pace in a group match washed out due to rain. Shaheen bowled skipper Rohit Sharma and then Virat Kohli, and fellow quicks Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah combined to dismiss India for 266 in the only innings possible in Pallekele. In the next meeting between the arch-rivals, the Pakistan quicks went for runs as India posted 356-2 in their 228-run win. Naseem and Rauf suffered injuries in the game in a blow to Pakistan ahead of the World Cup, but in an interview with AFP, Shaheen said his """"best is yet to come"""". Siraj blitz India fast bowler Mohammed Siraj saved the best for the last when he ripped through the Sri Lankan batting with six wickets including four in one over. Siraj returned his ODI best figures of 6-21 in a devastating spell of fast bowling in overcast conditions, to help skittle out Sri Lanka for 50 in 15.2 overs. The performance capped off a dominant few weeks for India after they crushed Pakistan by 228 runs in their Super Four match with centuries from Virat Kohli and KL Rahul. Opener Shubman Gill also made his presence felt with a sparkling 121 -- albeit in a lost cause -- in an inconsequential match against Bangladesh. Wellalage shines Dunith Wellalage was a part of Sri Lanka's young players who put up a strong show for the underdogs, after they snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan. The left-arm spinner claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in a Super Four clash versus India, and got the key wickets of Rohit and Kohli to bowl the opposition out for 213. Sri Lanka fell short in their chase despite Wellalage's unbeaten 42, but the performance from the 20-year-old boosted the team's confidence. Fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana and batsman Charith Asalanka then helped the island nation edge out Pakistan in a last-ball thriller to make the final. Rain warriors An army of 100 ground staff wearing orange jerseys ran with the covers every time rain halted play and were hailed as """"unsung heroes"""" by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and Sri Lanka Cricket. Rain played havoc in the tournament which had nine of the 13 matches played in Sri Lanka, after India refused to tour Pakistan due to political tensions. Showers in Pallekele meant the blockbuster India-Pakistan match was abandoned, and rain followed the teams to Colombo in a Super Four game which was awarded a reserve day -- much to the annoyance of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

""""All Members will receive a base distribution and then additional revenue will be in relation to contribution to the global game both on and off the field. This is by far the largest level of investment ever to go into cricket and it's a once in a generation opportunity for our Members to accelerate growth and engage more players and fans and drive competitiveness. """"I'm delighted that the board have also committed to a strategic investment fund which will help to accelerate the delivery of our Global Growth Strategy."""" The ICC Board also approved changes to ICC Sanctioning Regulations designed to support all Members to create sustainable revenue streams and develop the game whilst preserving and protecting the integrity of the sport and the welfare of those participating. Moving forwards, new events requiring a sanction will need to ensure the playing XI of each team will include a minimum of seven local or Associate Member players to support the development of the game. Additionally, a solidarity fee will be payable from the organizing Member to the Home Board of a player to reflect the role the Member played in developing and promoting the sport globally. The Chief Executives' Committee approved changes to over-rate sanctions in Test cricket to balance the need for over-rates to be maintained and ensure players are appropriately remunerated. As such players will be fined 5% of their match fee for each over short up to a maximum of 50%. If a team is bowled out before the new ball is due at 80 overs, there will be no over-rate penalty applied even if there is a slow over rate. This replaces the current 60 over threshold. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Meg Lanning wants to see cricket at the Olympics | The Daily Star","""Australia captain Meg Lanning is hoping the upcoming Commonwealth Games in Birmingham will provide a platform for cricket to eventually be played at the Olympics. Cricket will make a second appearance at the Commonwealth Games later this month when eight countries around the world battle it out in a 10-day Women's T20 tournament at Edgbaston. It will be the first time that cricket has been seen at the Commonwealth Games since Australia claimed a silver medal in the Men's tournament in Kuala Lumpur in 1998 and Lanning will be doing her utmost to go one better than compatriot Steve Waugh and help her team claim gold this time around. And Lanning is keen to help cricket attract a new audience in Birmingham that will eventually pave the way for the sport to be held at a summer Olympics in the future. """"Cricket in the Olympics would be amazing. Especially for the game as well, to reach a new audience,"""" Lanning told BBC Sport. """"It would allow different people to see that game would really help the growth of it in other countries around the world, and particularly for women."""" The next summer Olympics are scheduled to be held in Paris in 2024, before the Games move to Los Angeles in 2028 and Brisbane in Lanning's home nation some four years later in 2032. While Lanning would love nothing more than seeing cricket make an entry to the Olympics from 2028, the 30-year-old remains realistic and expects it to happen after she has retired from the game. """"I'm not really sure what it takes to get it into the Olympics, but from the perspective of players, it would be amazing,"""" Lanning added. """"It's something I'd love to do but I think if it was going to happen, it will probably be once I've finished up playing."""" While Lanning's long-term dream is to see cricket at the Olympics, the Australia skipper's immediate thoughts are with trying to help her side add to their ever-growing list of tournament victories by winning gold in Birmingham. Lanning and Australia have already tasted success this year by claiming the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup in New Zealand and the Australia captain wants to add to her bulging trophy cabinet with a Commonwealth Games gold medal. """"We're looking at it as a very unique opportunity. We want to win that gold medal,"""" Lanning said. """"Our group is really excited about it.

The International Cricket Council (ICC), the game's global governing body, has proposed a new revenue sharing model for the 2024-27 cycle to be voted on at its next board meeting in June. According to figures leaked to Cricinfo, India would claim 38.5%, while England and Australia would pocket 6.89% and 6.25% respectively. Pakistan stands to earn 5.75% of the ICC's projected earnings, primarily from its media rights sale. The 12 full members of the ICC would collectively get 88.81%, while the rest would be distributed among its 96 associate members. """"We are insisting that the ICC should tell us how these figures were arrived at,"""" Sethi told Reuters from London. """"We are not happy with the situation as it stands. """"Come June, when the board is expected to approve the financial model, unless these details are provided to us, we are not going to approve it."""" India generates an estimated 80% of ICC revenue and Disney Star shelled out $3 billion last year to acquire the 2024-27 media rights for the Indian market. Sethi said the PCB had already asked the ICC to explain how its finance and commercial affairs committee, headed by Indian cricket board secretary Jay Shah, determined the share. Despite the fact that all nations will get more money, Sethi said at least two other test playing nations were not happy with the model and had sought more details. The ICC, which considered factors such as the performance of a country's men's and women's teams and their contribution to the ICC's commercial revenue, was not immediately available to comment. """"In principle, India should get more, there is no doubt about that but ... how is this table being developed?"""" Sethi said. The proposed revenue split has become a major talking point in world cricket, which is already facing a rapidly altering landscape because of the Indian-driven rise of franchise-based leagues. Former England captain Mike Atherton, writing in The Times newspaper on Monday, criticised the """"flawed"""" model, which he feared would only deepen the game's existing inequality.

Sethi, however, cautioned that for the dream fixture to go ahead, the board must first receive permission from the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government. Sethi's comments came after every stakeholder, including Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Jay Shah, agreed to organise the upcoming Asia Cup in a hybrid model, as proposed by the PCB chief. """"As far as India and Pakistan go, neither the PCB or the BCCI can take decisions. The respective governments only can take decisions,"""" Sethi said during a press conference.

Jos Buttler-inspired England and a Babar Azam-led Pakistan will be squaring off at the iconing Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday, hoping to lift their second T20 World Cup title and keeping an eye on the heavens, wishing for its doors not to open and ruin the title decider. Pakistan, England or rain – who will steal the spotlight? As we head towards the mouth-watering contest, let’s take a gander at some interesting facts and hope the finale lives up to the billing. Jos Buttler used to fantasise about captaining England to cricketing glory when he played with his siblings in their garden as a child. Now the dream is on the cusp of coming true. No matter what happens when Pakistan face England in Sunday's final at the MCG, Shadab Khan has had a Twenty20 World Cup to remember. England pace spearhead Mark Wood said he is unsure if he will recover from a hip injury in time to play in Sunday's Twenty20 World Cup final against Pakistan but could throw his name into the hat if skipper Jos Buttler desperately needs him. Captain Babar Azam told his rejuvenated Pakistan side on Saturday to ride the wave of four consecutive victories and win the Twenty20 World Cup final. Skipper Jos Buttler says the emphatic way England crushed India to reach Sunday's Twenty20 World Cup final """"doesn't count for anything"""" as they bid to become champions in both white-ball formats. Pakistan have soaked up stories from the landmark 1992 Cricket World Cup final win over England in the lead up to Sunday's Twenty20 decider and hope to share their own tales of triumph in years to come, team mentor Matthew Hayden said on Friday.

"Bangladesh-Ireland Series 2023 | The Daily Star","""Balbirnie found Liton’s glasses while batting in the first innings to be quite amusing. According to the Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, it is not necessary for him to bowl if he has five to six different options in his arsenal. Mushfiqur Rahim’s stellar outing with the bat against Ireland in the one-off Test in Mirpur, which ended with Bangladesh winning by seven wickets today, saw him cross the 14000-run mark in international cricket. Previously, board president Nazmul Hassan had stated a numerous times that the board were not going to allow players to feature in franchise leagues during international assignments. Bangladesh handed Ireland a seven-wicket defeat as the home side chased down a 138-run target before the end of the second session on the fourth day of the one-off Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur on Friday. Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan’s decision to not introduce himself into the bowling attack till the 66th over of the first innings against Ireland raised a lot of questions on the opening day of their lone Test in Mirpur. Shakib, eventually, bowled only three overs on that day. Ireland had appeared to be on the verge of defeat with top-order failing to counter Shakib Al Hasan and Taijul Islam in the final session on day two. From there, they found a way on day three to make Bangladesh toil on a hot and humid day. Few would have given Ireland to avoid an innings defeat, let alone stage a turnaround to keep the Mirpur Test alive as they began day three at 27 for four, but the visitors managed to claw their way back into the one-off Test against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium today. Ireland wicketkeeper-batter Lorcan Tucker joins a long list of cricketers who managed to score a century on Test debut as Ireland continue to stage an exceptional turnaround against Bangladesh in the third day of the one-off Test in Mirpur today. Following a productive first session on the third day, Ireland were on course to claw back their way into the match against Bangladesh in the one-off Test in Mirpur. However, the loss of set batter Harry Tector has given the visitors a big setback. Bangladesh remain in a strong position as their lead stretch past 100 on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh’s veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim brought up his 10th Test ton during the Tigers’ lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh Test and T20I skipper Shakib Al Hasan’s wait for his sixth Test ton continues as the star all-rounder fell just 13 short of the landmark score in their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Despite losing Mominul Haque early, Bangladesh dominated the morning session on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan and veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim started rebuilding after Mominul Haque departed early on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Candy Lappin, his mother was enjoying the cricket too, having seen the young players turn into international stars. Bangladesh spinners Taijul Islam and Mehedi Hasan Miraz combined to scalp three wickets in quick succession to leave Ireland struggling in the second session on the opening day of their one-off Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Oddly enough, Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan is yet to introduce himself even after over 40 overs bowled during the Tigers’ one-off Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today.

"‘I never played against someone who batted with sunglasses’ | The Daily Star","""Liton Das was donning a sunglass in the first innings but did not wear one as he came out to open in the second innings. Mark Adair got the better of Liton in the second innings after a rapid start and the bowler gave a send-off to Liton, motioning to put on his sunglasses to watch where the ball had gone. Adair bowled a bouncer which hit Liton's helmet before the ball ricocheted off Liton's bat to crash on to the stumps. Liton was perplexed for a moment, wondering how the ball went behind and hit his stumps to castle him but Adair, who enjoyed the wicket, told Liton to put on the glasses again. Asked on Adair's send-off, Balbirnie found Liton's glasses while batting in the first innings to be quite amusing. """"I never played against someone who batted with sunglasses on. It looked pretty cool. I wouldn't be doing it myself. I'm not sure whether there was a prescription. He played nicely in the first innings but it was just a bit of fun. We were trying to create an uncomfortable atmosphere,"""" Balbirnie said at the press conference today. Liton departed for a 19-ball 23 but his innings provided the momentum to avert pressure during the chase. Najmul Hossain Shanto was coming in next after Liton and Ireland skipper said that they wanted to create pressure on the batter coming in to the crease. """"With Shanto obviously we tried to create something cause he was gone first ball for a duck in the first innings and we tried to create a bit of pressure for him there cause we knew in order to win the game, we had to do something different. Yeah Mark enjoyed that one,"""" Balbirnie said. Bangladesh went on to win with seven wickets in hand after unbeaten knocks of 51 and 20 from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mominul Haque respectively. Asked if they felt that they could have won, Ireland captain said all the pressure to win was on Bangladesh. """"100 per cent (felt we had a chance of winning this morning). The wicket was still pretty good, Ebadot bowled well, he attacked the stumps but we were confident we could get a 180 lead. Our message was all the pressure was on Bangladesh. If they had lost this game there would have been a lot more people in this press room. Even if they were 100 for none chasing 130 the pressure was on them, no-one expected Ireland to come here and win a Test match. We knew we needed early wickets but the way Liton played took the momentum away but we stuck at it, created chances, but it just wasn't to be,"""" he added on Ireland's fight. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket: Taijul, Hom in for T20Is","""Tanbir Haydar is the only player from the ODI squad who has not found a place in the Bangladesh team for the first T20I against New Zealand, set to take place in Napier on January 3. The leg-spinner has been replaced by slow left-armer Taijul Islam. Mushfiqur Rahim, who had injured himself in the first ODI, also didn't find a place in the squad and it will be Nurul Hasan who will be keeping stumps. In addition, off-spinner Mehedi Hasan Miraz, who was a part of the ODI squad has also been left out. He has been replaced by Shuvagata Hom. As such, Shubhashis Roy and Taijul Islam are the two uncapped players in this squad. Like 2016, Bangladesh will begin this year with the T20I format as well. The Tigers played more T20Is last year than any other format as they wanted to prepare themselves for the ICC World Twenty20. So far, Bangladesh have played four T20Is against New Zealand and have lost all of them. The last time these two teams met in the shortest format was during the ICC WorldTwenty20 on March 26. While Mustafizur Rahman did take a five-wicket haul in that game, the Tigers were thrashed by 75 runs. 11 members from that World Cup squad have been included in this squad. Meanwhile, New Zealand opener New Zealand opener Martin Guptill will miss the Twenty20 series against Bangladesh with a hamstring injury and has been replaced by in-form batsman Neil Broom, the country's cricket board announced yesterday. Guptill will be sidelined for up to four weeks after he sustained the injury while running between the wickets in the third one-day international against Bangladesh at Saxton Oval in Nelson on Saturday.

"Kiwis flying high | The Daily Star","""New Zealand looked to be in a spot of bother towards the start of their innings in the third and final ODI against Bangladesh at the Saxton Oval yesterday. Mustafizur Rahman had sent Tom Latham packing just four balls into the second over of the innings and Martin Guptill suddenly pulled up after completing a single before retiring hurt, effectively leaving the Kiwis 16 for two in the face of a 237-run target. However, the Kiwis knew they still had a shot at the target, especially captain Kane Williamson at the crease. Even more encouragement came from the fact that at the other end stood Neil Broom, who had made a century in the last match and was high on confidence. As they had hoped, the partnership proved to be the most fruitful one of the series as the pair shared a 179-run stand and took the Kiwis to the brink of a win before Broom departed for 97. Speaking at the post-match presentation ceremony, the New Zealand skipper was effusive in his praise for Broom, who had made his comeback to the national team after a gap of six years when he took to the field against Bangladesh in the first ODI. """"Neil Broom adjusted superbly on two different surfaces. He is a very, very good player.” Williamson also expressed his admiration for the way that Bangladesh had coped with the very unfamiliar conditions down under. """"Credit to Bangladesh for fighting in conditions they aren't entirely used to. The way seamers adjusted their lengths was very, very good, in addition to how Jeets [Jeetan Patel] and [Mitchell] Santner bowled."""" While Williamson's demeanour in front of the press was a more subdued one, Jimmy Neesham shared an interesting exchange between himself and the skipper on Twitter after the match. With the hosts requiring three to win, Neesham blasted a boundary and he claimed that he was only following his skipper's orders. “I blocked out an over then he [Williamson] came down and said: “just bang it mate lets go have a beer”,” wrote Neesham on his Twitter page. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Tigers feel Mushy's absence | The Daily Star","""So it is a three-nil whitewash at the hands of the Black Caps on their home turf. And the result was not unexpected when the Tigers embarked on their first trip down under after a gap of five years. However, there were expectations that this new brand of Tigers would be competitive this time around. They were competitive in the context that they created an opportunity, especially in the last two games at the Saxton Oval in the form of two good partnerships and with a commanding bowling performance in the second ODI when they restricted their opponents to a total they should have chased down on the back of a 75-run second-wicket partnership. But the crux of the problem laid somewhere else and the first and foremost reason is the absence of Mushfiqur Rahim due to injury in the last two games. His absence actually upset the balance of the team as it is his presence deep in the middle-order which provides a bridge between the top and the lower half. And that was completely missing in the experimental side full of back-up players like Tanbir Hayder, Mosaddek Hossain and Nurul Hasan. Tanbir was very disappointing with the bat in the two matches he played. He was also extremely lucky with his leg-spin in the first game because he bowled at a time when the opposition went onto the defensive. It could have been a disaster for him had Mashrafe not withdrawn him from the attack yesterday after his two overs yielded 20 runs. Mosaddek might have played well in the shadow of Mushfiqur in the opening game, but lacked that mental maturity when he was left with the demanding task of doing it all alone. Mushfiqur's replacement Nurul Hasan really played well and perhaps was the best among the three players who made their one-day debut in the series. But the most disheartening aspect is that Nurul Hasan has not been trusted by the team management and that is why he batted at number seven in the second one-dayer. He was promoted to number six in the third game yesterday and scored a fine 44 off 39 balls. He did not slog and perhaps the right-hander was more comfortable with the tennis ball bounce of the wicket than more established batsmen. Skipper Mashrafe accepted the fact that the back-up force in the team left a lot to be desired. He also observed that they did not have a replacement for a player like Soumya Sarker, let alone a proven and committed one like Mushfiqur. The other disheartening aspect is the absence of additional responsibility from the senior players in the team, especially in Mushfiqur's absence. Mahmudullah was painfully out of touch in the series and scored 0, 1 and 3. Shakib Al Hasan did little to justify his match-winning ability. Tamim Iqbal might have scored a fifty after five games, but he lacked the discipline to carry on till the end. Imrul has done little to improve on his skills when it comes to chasing singles instead of playing dot balls. The clarity of thinking from the coaching staff was another contributing factor in the recipe for defeats. It was certainly not wise thinking on their part to introduce a leg-spinner in hostile conditions. Besides, Tanbir has never been considered as quality leg-spinner in the domestic circuit. He was also an average lower-order batsman. Mashrafe offered some solace for the leggie yesterday when he said: “It was very tough for him to adjust to the conditions”. Besides, after Mushfiqur got injured the team management should have turned to experience to fill that big void. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket","""Defending champions Sydney Thunder and Sydney Sixers will tackle a Bangladesh Cricket Board XI as part of their preparation for this summer’s KFC Twenty20 Big Bash League. The Sixers will meet the BCB XI December 14 at North Sydney Oval, with the fixture against the Thunder to be staged two days later at Spotless Stadium, reports cricket.com.au The games will act as warm-up matches for Bangladesh ahead of their month-long tour of New Zealand, which will comprise five one-day internationals and two Test matches. Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha, who previously coached New South Wales and the Thunder, said competing against some of Australia’s best short-form players would be a valuable opportunity for his group. “We’ll get a lot out of it, playing in different conditions against teams in Australia,” Hathurusingha said. “With the Thunder I thought it was a good way to see how these guys measured up against the champions as it’ll give us a lot of confidence if we do well. “And playing a BBL team like Sixers gives Bangladesh players greater exposure and confidence. North Sydney Oval is a great place to play cricket for players and for spectators to watch cricket. “We are grateful for the opportunity.” Bangladesh will be based at Blacktown International Sports Park (BISP) during their stay and Hathurusingha said that would also help them acclimatise to similar conditions in New Zealand. The Tigers kick off their NZ tour with an ODI in Christchurch on December 26. They will be looking to build on recent good performances after pushing England all the way in a 22-run loss in the first Test in Chittagong. Bangladesh is ninth in the ICC Test rankings and seventh in the ODI rankings. “The main purpose of having this camp in Sydney on our way to New Zealand is getting used to conditions closer to what we’re expecting in New Zealand, which we can't create back in Bangladesh,” Hathurusingha said. “We were impressed with the facility at BISP provided to us during the World Cup in 2015 and that is the reason we choose BISP as well.” Former Sydney Thunder captain and director of cricket Michael Hussey said the practice game would provide perfect preparation. “Our focus ahead of BBL 06 has been to play competitive games against high-quality opposition,” Hussey said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how we match up against some very exciting international stars. “Getting to play at Spotless Stadium will provide valuable practice four days ahead of the season.” Sydney Sixers General Manager Dom Remond said the club was expecting a big turnout at North Sydney Oval. “The local Bangladesh community will have the opportunity to see the national heroes against the full Sixers squad up close and personal,” Redmond said. “Playing under lights will add another element to the contest and with a very affordable ticket price of $10 for adults and free for kids under 16, we are expecting a capacity crowd.” Members of the Sixers and Thunder will get free entry to their club's relevant match. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket","""There were three great actors in the classic Test that ended in Chittagong's Zahur Ahmed Stadium yesterday -- winners England, heroic losers Bangladesh and the pitch that made the displays of resolve and resource from both teams possible. The pitch -- a parched one in appearance -- was an excellent one for Test cricket because while it was quite unusual in that it turned from the first ball of day one, it was unique in that it did not break or become dangerous over time. The turn was consistent, as was the bounce. """"If you come tomorrow, you will not be able to tell it apart from the other pitches on the square,"""" said Zahid Reza Babu, the curator, to the Daily Star yesterday afternoon. Although he is barred from commenting on pitch preparation, this comment indicates that the reason the pitch held so well together was because of the grassy sub-surface that binds the soil. Generally the men behind the scenes that make such entertainment possible remain hidden from view because their work is done when the cameras are turned off or focused on other things. Still, the role of the pitch in this cracker of a match was so central that Babu was shown as a smiling presence on the sidelines as the action unfolded in the middle on numerous occasions during the match. But for once, the man behind the scenes was brought forward by Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim yesterday. """"Babu bhai has made an amazing wicket,"""" the skipper gushed at the post-match press conference yesterday. """"This is the first time that we got a wicket suited to our plans. The positive sign was that we took 20 wickets."""" These may seem like simple words, but they were golden for Babu. In a chat with The Daily Star in his office at the ZACS yesterday afternoon, he proudly listed Bangladesh's mostly positive results at the ZACS after he had taken charge of the ground in 2010. """"We can ask for nothing more than this. We do not hear words like this,"""" said Babu. """"We do a thankless job mostly. This is our prize, that he said this in front of the media is the biggest thing in my life. It is reward for the work I have done all these years. """"Mushfiqur even thanked me on his way out of the stadium after the match just a little while ago,"""" said the delighted curator. His impact on this match was such that Sabbir Rahman, the young batsman who proved to the world over the last two days just how mentally strong he is with a debut half-century in trying conditions, came after the match and hugged 'Babu bhai' for providing him the opportunity. """"I told him that you will be part of history, and I have just joined you in a small way.

I thought we would be able to create enough chances. But the doubt was whether we would be able to take those chances. """"It was a brilliant Test match.

The crucial moment was in day three when we managed to get a lead and that proved the difference obviously,"""" said Cook after the match in Chittagong.

I took my time last night and floated around with a few ideas in my head and then decided it would be Broad's and Stokes. I think the real reason was that they would be able to take more runs against the spinners. Once the new ball was available I would have used the spinners, but if you used the spinners early on, you couldn't have changed,"""" he said. He also gave credit to Bangladesh for coming so close in the fourth innings. """"The way they played spin in these conditions, they deserve a lot of credit. I genuinely thought 280 was enough at first,"""" said Cook. Furthermore, he added that there would definitely be changes in the second Test in order to give more players a chance ahead of their Tests against India. """"It's certainly more about rotation and also in an ideal world we don't want to get to India with people having not played much cricket. There are some fine players who didn't make that team and also the conditions of how hot it is and energy levels, knowing they will not be playing all seven Test matches will freshen things up as well.

""""It's been a pinpoint of myself against spin and knowing that I can take the aggressive route.

"Anatomy of a classic | The Daily Star","""'In a way it is a pity that there had to be a loser at the end of this Test' – England skipper Alastair Cook after the 22-run win over Bangladesh yesterday. England won the toss and Bangladesh debutant off-spinner Mehedi Hasan Miraz opened the bowling and bowled Ben Duckett with a peach. Shakib Al Hasan had England captain Cook bowled off the sweep before Miraz trapped Gary Ballance in front. Joe Root came out and played classy shots, but it was Bangladesh's morning. Winner: Bangladesh  Joe Root was dismissed by Miraz early in the session before Ben Stokes was castled by a sharp turner by Shakib to leave England at five for 106. But Moeen Ali batted with Jonny Bairstow to take England to some respectability. But five wickets by tea after winning the toss makes it Bangladesh's afternoon. Winner: Bangladesh Miraz bagged two more wickets – those of Bairstow and Ali -- and had a debut five-for to have England seven down for 237. But by that time the pitch and its demons became apparent, so England ideally should have been dismissed by the end of the day. Winner: Undecided Bangladesh bowl out England for 293, with Miraz picking up Chris Woakes and Stuart Broad and Taijul Islam picking up Adil Rashid. 293 seemed enough especially with Ali dismissing Imrul Kayes and Mominul Haque in the last over before lunch. Winner: England Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah Riyad puts on a 90-run partnership, batting beautifully on the tough pitch against England's spinners. Riyad however departs to what turns out to be the last ball before tea. But their partnership takes Bangladesh to a good position to overtake England's total. Winner: Bangladesh Tamim falls for a monk-like 78 off 179 deliveries to Gareth Batty with the score on 163 for four. Mushfiqur and Shakib then put on a 58-run stand, but with the close in sight Mushfiqur is caught at slip off Ben Stokes. Winner: Undecided A suicidal leap down the wicket that had Shakib stumped off the second ball of the day saw Bangladesh's last five wickets fall for 27 runs as the home side were all out for 248, 45 runs behind. Shakib tried to make amends with the ball however, taking the wickets of Duckett and Root after Miraz dismissed Cook. Winner: England  Ballance fell to Taijul and Ali became Shakib's third wicket as England stumbled to 62 for five. Disciplined batting from Stokes and Bairstow took England to 108 but Bangladesh were scenting a quick end to England's innings and a chaseable total despite the costly deficit. Winner: Bangladesh Stokes played his best innings against spin bowling and put on a 127-run partnership with Bairstow. Kamrul Islam Rabbi bowled Bairstow for his first wicket and Shakib picked up his 15th five-for by dismissing Stokes and Rashid, but it seemed too late as the lead had already swelled to 273. Winner: England After Broad was run out and Taijul claimed Woakes within four overs of the start, Bangladesh rocketed to 86 by lunch, exactly 200 runs adrift of a historic chase. Imrul provided the impetus with 43, but was out sweeping Rashid while Tamim was claimed by Ali at short leg. Winner: Bangladesh Riyad's edgy knock came to an end when he played across the line to Batty after Mominul had fell to the same bowler. Shakib edged Ali behind to leave Bangladesh at 140 for five and the Test seemingly lost. But then Mushfiqur and Sabbir began batting. Winner: England Mushfiqur and Sabbir batted courageously and with purpose in an 87-run stand that took them to within 59 runs of victory. Then a Batty delivery spat up and the skipper was gone. Miraz and Rabbi followed quickly to Broad before Sabbir and Taijul took them to the close with hopes still alive. Winner: England There was only 19 minutes of play as Stokes completed a stellar match by removing Taijul and Shafiul Islam in the space of three balls after 10 runs were added to the overnight score.

A cricket fandom raised and sustained on limited-overs cricket sat in front of their television sets all over the country, commenting on social media in droves about a Test match that only had 33 runs and two wickets in it. At the end of those 19 minutes, a disconsolate Sabbir Rahman sat hunched on the pitch, head bowed. At first Stuart Broad -- the man who on the previous evening had played a major hand in the young man's eventual despair -- came into the picture and put a consoling hand on the shoulder of the debutant who has played such a stirring hand in bringing his country to the brink of their greatest cricketing achievement to date, only to see it snatched away in the space of three deliveries. Joe Root then hunched down beside his fellow batsman, opened his own helmet and said a few words. Sabbir just sat with his head propped up by the handle of the bat, which he had propped up on the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury pitch that played a starring role in producing not only the greatest Test on Bangladesh soil, but one of the best Test matches in recent memory. Could he have been thinking that he should have allowed Taijul Islam to face as many as 33 out of 51 deliveries during their 25-run partnership? As the batsman likeliest to have taken them home, Sabbir ideally should have played the lion's share. It wasn't the debutants fault -- it was a team decision based on Taijul not being an absolute mug with the bat, but it eventually proved a gamble too far. For the statisticians, Bangladesh lost the first Test against England by 22 runs in Chittagong on the fifth morning yesterday. Over four days and 19 minutes of cricket 1044 runs were scored from 2110 deliveries and the 40th wicket fell when number 11 batsman Shafiul Islam was adjudged leg-before by umpire Kumar Dharmasena off a reverse swinging ball by player-of-the-match Ben Stokes. The 26th review of the match was asked for by Shafiul, but there would be no 12th overturn of an umpire's decision. Three deliveries ago England had successfully reviewed a leg-before call against Taijul Islam and Stokes claimed the visitors' ninth wicket. Before that, an assured start from Sabbir, who resumed the day on 59, and a top-edged hook from Taijul that went to the boundary behind the keeper had shaved 10 runs off the 33 that was on every cricket fan's tongue before start of play. Then it was over, as most feared it would be. A 286-run target on a pitch as difficult as this one was not expected to be chased. It was by all accounts thought to be beyond a side that had only once chased a target over 200, that too against an attack much inferior and on a pitch much friendlier. But this match was about much more than the statistics show, although they do reveal a lot. It was about a Bangladesh side playing a Test after almost 15 months and an England team that encountered conditions as alien to them as can be imagined. Both sides played their part in the spectacle but even in defeat this Test perhaps means more to Bangladesh. Coming into this match with three debutants and a pace attack that is not their first choice, they kept pace with England throughout the match. Mehedi Hasan announced himself as a formidable young prospect with a debut five-wicket haul and a disciplined mind that belies his youth. Sabbir displayed a strength of character not many would have expected from a player often called a limited-overs specialist. Hit on the side of the helmet off his 23rd ball in Test cricket in the first innings, he came back in the second to play an innings that nearly took his team home even after Shakib Al Hasan had departed with 147 runs to go, and skipper Mushfiqur Rahim left with 59 runs left. The skipper himself was immense in this match. He formulated the strategy that has suddenly made Bangladesh look like a side that can win Test matches. He executed that strategy to near perfection. He thought on his feet on the field, and set imaginative fields throughout the Test, giving his strength the best chance of picking up 20 wickets -- which Bangladesh did for only the ninth time in 94 Tests. As importantly, his keeping was nearly flawless and at times brilliant, such as the take to dismiss Moeen Ali in the first innings. Along with Tamim Iqbal in the first innings and Sabbir in the second, Mushfiqur's batting on the fourth day revealed another dimension of Bangladesh's batting, generally known to be good strokeplayers but not great grafters in tough situations. It does not get much tougher than the 87 runs he put on with Sabbir for the sixth wicket on Sunday. At the end of the match, there were two differences between the teams that brought about the narrow result. The reverse swing that Stokes and Broad exploited to such ruthless effect was missing among Bangladesh's pacers and had those home batsmen not experienced in international cricket all at sea, but that could be offset by Bangladesh's superior spin attack and their better batting against spin. The most crucial difference however was circumstantial -- Bangladesh's 45-run first-innings deficit which came about when they lost five wickets for 27 runs on the third morning after Shakib Al Hasan's suicidal swipe. So hopes and heads should be held high as they start preparing for the second Test in Mirpur starting on Friday. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Sabbir to see doctor for stomach pain | The Daily Star","""Mosaddek Hossain has been included in the squad for the second Test against England, set to begin in Mirpur from Friday, as a safety net for Sabbir Rahman, who has complained of a stomach pain. In addition, the national selectors have also replaced Shafiul Islam with the uncapped Shuvashish Roy. Sabbir, who played a magnificent knock in the second innings of the first Test, will undergo an endoscopy as soon as the team returns to Dhaka from Chittagong today in order to know the state of his health. He has an appointment with the doctor today. The batsman has been complaining about a stomach-related pain since the beginning of the first Test. A primary examination in Chittagong though didn't find anything wrong. “Sabbir is a little sick and that's why we brought Mosaddek to the squad as a back-up. With regards to Shafiul, we felt that he needed a break as he played the ODIs and the first Test. Shuvashish has done well in domestic cricket and he was the next best option for us,” explained chief selector Minhajul Abedin while speaking to The Daily Star yesterday.

"Bangladesh Cricket: Tigers expose England shortcomings","""Ben Stokes underlined his growing reputation as the finest allrounder in world cricket with another show-stopping performance on the final day of the first Test against Bangladesh. However, if England believe it has done anything other than paper over the cracks ahead of the upcoming five-Test series in India, then they are mistaken, reports cricket.com.au This tour of Bangladesh has been seen by many as a glorified warm-up before the main event of England's winter begins. Yet this emerging nation showed they are a side who should be feared in home conditions after giving Alastair Cook's side an almighty scare in the closest Test finish since England beat Australia by 12 runs in the opening match of the 2013 Ashes series at Trent Bridge. England, who were victorious here by 22 runs, did manage to avoid humiliation thanks to two Stokes wickets on the final morning. Yet similar shortcomings in their performance will be brutally exposed by India. Two top-order collapses on a spinning pitch might have been terminal to their hopes if it were not for momentum-changing half-centuries in each innings from Moeen Ali and Stokes. The spinners, too, came up short as a collective despite moments of individual brilliance from Moeen, Adil Rashid and Gareth Batty. Cook defended his spin trio after this first Test, despite showing little faith in their ability to finish off the job on the final morning. Stokes and Stuart Broad were instead entrusted with securing victory, Cook gambling on that pair's ability to find the reverse swing that they had in the first innings. That Stokes did – finagling the final two wickets in the space of three balls – justified Cook's decision. But the spinners are going to have to step up if England are to remotely stretch India in the five Tests that await. Moeen had a good Test, scoring 68 in the first innings and looking the most threatening of his side's spinners as he took five wickets in the match. However, Batty struggled for long periods despite taking four wickets, while Rashid, the leg-spinner who should eat tail-end batsmen for breakfast, took just three in the entire match. The Yorkshire leggie is still too prone to bowling loose deliveries and in such a tight contest as this, he could not be trusted. Cook, though, leapt to the defence of his spinners when saying: """"I think they bowled pretty well. It's a different mentality when the ball spins like that - very quickly the expectation goes onto the spinners - 'oh you must take wickets.' """"I thought they handled themselves very well. We maybe missed length a little bit too much to be absolutely on it, and maybe let the pressure off, but I genuinely believe they will get better."""" The top order, too, need to improve. Cook, who dashed back to Bangladesh 72 hours before the Test after returning home to attend the birth of his second child, made 16 runs in his England-record 134th Test. Debutant Ben Duckett, Joe Root, and Gary Ballance also struggled as England collapsed twice in each innings. """"Scoring however many runs on that wicket was a real credit to us as a side,"""" said Cook. """"Not everyone scored runs but it was as tough batting conditions as I can remember, certainly early on and against spin, so to be able to score that number of runs shows that what we've been working on as a side over the last two years."""" Changes will be made for the second Test in Dhaka, starting on Friday, with Stuart Broad and perhaps Chris Woakes rested ahead of India. """"I'm pretty sure there will be some changes, just due to what we have coming up,"""" Cook said. """"In an ideal world we don't want to get to India with people having not played much cricket."""" However, despite England's shortcomings they won a match in conditions and against a team some other teams around the world – perhaps even Australia – would have lost. For that they can thank Stokes, whose six wickets and 85 second-innings runs were the difference between the two teams. """"I say it every single time we speak about Ben, the guy is that x-factor cricketer which every side would love to have,"""" said Cook. """"He balances our side, he gives us options, he allows us to play the extra seamer here or an extra spinner, whichever you look at it."""" England, though, will need more than just Stokes to be at the top of his game if they are to continue their winning ways on the sub-continent. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket","""Bangladesh pacer Taskin Ahmed has an eventful career so far and so it seems only fitting that he attempted to add a little colour to it also, although he might have done so in a far too literal sense when he shocked the nation on Sunday with his new look. The man from Mohammadpur was possibly trying to emulate sports greats such as Messi, who change their look depending on their form and such, when he donned his new blonde haircut. It seems however that the public did not take it well and took to social media to blast the style, ultimately prompting the young tiger to change the colour to a more sober one just a day after. Taskin posted a new picture on his Facebook profile yesterday with his new spikes but old colour with the simple caption: “If my #fans are happy..then I am also happy...cheers guys, now okay?” The young cricketer clearly values his followers' opinions greatly and so one can only hope that we can return the favour by supporting his fashion sense in the future.   দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"'Deficit made a massive difference' | The Daily Star","""The first Test may have ended in heartbreak, with a debutant showing unexpected strength of character to take Bangladesh within 22 runs of a steep 286-run target on a trying pitch. But in keeping with the skipper's hopes expressed before the match, Bangladesh had -- perhaps for the first time -- truly competed in every session against a team deemed far superior by popular opinion as well as official rankings. """"The biggest achievement is to have played consistently for the whole Test match,"""" said a downbeat Mushfiqur after the match yesterday. """"I think we have done that 90-95 per cent of the time but we could have done better in some areas. We can take a lot of positives – [Mehedi Hasan] Miraz and Shakib [Al Hasan] bowled well. Tamim batted well, and it wasn't in his character to bat like he did. Sabbir [Rahman] batted well too. It was a good Test for Bangladesh. """"Nobody expected Bangladesh to play in this manner after 15 months so we had to prove that we could do something. We showed our character to a side like England. It was a learning experience."""" Mushfiqur identified the first innings deficit of 45 runs as a major turning point in a close Test match. In that respect Shakib Al Hasan's wild heave that resulted in a stumping off the second ball of the third day when Bangladesh were 72 behind was crucial. """"Those runs made a massive difference. We replied with five early wickets in their second innings and then Stokes put up that big partnership but I still think that had we gone close to their 290, the Test match could have taken a different path. It did matter in the end. """"I think he [Shakib] realises that he didn't do the right thing. We didn't expect this from such a matured player. We want him to have more impact for the team and it is something we can all learn from."""" The pragmatist in Mushfiqur came out when he said before the match that Bangladesh would not become an extraordinary team even if they won the match. He stayed true to that sentiment after the game as well. """"Thirty runs and two wickets is a difficult equation. The match was tilted towards them almost 90 per cent. I think almost everyone in their line-up have first-class 100s. We don't have any tail-ender who has a first-class hundred, and even if we did, there's a huge difference between their first-class cricket and our first-class cricket,"""" he said. And that was a glimpse of the Mushfiqur the media and fans have missed for much of the last 15 months -- his straight-talking persona that often cuts to the heart of the problems in Bangladesh cricket. That was the side of Mushfiqur that came out when asked about the Bangladesh pace bowlers as England's lethality with the reverse swinging ball proved a crucial difference in the end. """"Does anyone know how many first-class bowlers we have who can bowl well with the old ball?"""" asked Mushfiqur. """"If you look at a scorecard from our first-class competitions, you will invariably see a spinner taking a five-for and the pace bowlers taking one or two wickets. If a bowler doesn't know how to set up a batsman, and bowl according to the field, then you can't expect him to do it at the Test level. It is easy for guys like [Stuart] Broad and [Ben] Stokes who have been doing it for years. I don't think Shafiul [Islam] and Kamrul [Islam Rabbi] bowled that badly. It was a learning experience for them, and they realised that they need to know how to bowl with the old ball."""" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"‘World Cup performance will help us in New Zealand’ | The Daily Star","""Having aced one of their biggest obstacles—beating a top ranked side in Tests—the Bangladesh national team is surging in confidence. Their next assignment is an away tour of New Zealand, scheduled to begin on December 26. Going by Bangladesh’s poor record abroad, it won’t be a surprise to find the Tigers a tad bit nervous. After all, the conditions in New Zealand have troubled the best of teams in the past. However, ace allrounder Shakib Al Hasan reckons Bangladesh can do well in New Zealand. Speaking to reporters during an event in the capital, he said: “In the past, we used to be a bit nervous about an away series. We used to be concerned about our performance and the condition and things like that. But after playing well in the World Cup [in Australia and New Zealand in 2015] we have gained plenty of confidence. “The pacers had bowled well and so did the spinners. Hopefully something good will happen this time,” he added. While the slow left-armer did say that the Tigers would be confident, he did however, admit that it would be a difficult task for Bangladesh. “Playing in New Zealand won’t be easy for us and that’s why we need to prepare well for them in Australia. The camp in Australia will help us a lot for the New Zealand series. We hope to make the most of that time,” said Shakib. Prior to the New Zealand series, Bangladesh will take part in a preparatory camp in New Zealand in order to adjust to the conditions. A 22-member squad will leave for Australia, where they will be playing a number of games including two against Big Bash teams, on December 9. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Root, Pope lead England nearer New Zealand sweep | The Daily Star","""Jack Leach took 10 wickets in a Test for the first time in his career before Ollie Pope and Joe Root set about leading England's charge to a series whitewash of New Zealand at Headingley on Sunday. England were 183-2 at stumps on the fourth day of the third and final Test, needing just a further 113 runs to reach a target of 296 on Monday's last day. Pope was 81 not out and Root, on his Yorkshire home ground, 55 not out, with the third-wicket pair having shared an unbroken stand of 132. England will be firm favourites to wrap up a 3-0 series success over Test world champions New Zealand after chasing down stiff targets of 277 and 299 in five-wicket wins at Lord's and Trent Bridge respectively. Alex Lees was run out attempting a needless single when New Zealand captain Kane Williamson's throw was well gathered-in by bowler Trent Boult. Zak Crawley's innings ended in familiar fashion when, having made 25 that included 24 runs in boundaries, he tamely chipped spinner Michael Bracewell to Williamson at cover. Former captain Root came in with England 51-2. Even while presiding over a run of just one win from 17 Tests prior to this series that prompted his resignation as captain, Root's own form never dipped -- in 2021 he scored 1,708 Test runs at a superb average of 61. Such was New Zealand's desire to dismiss Root they wasted two of their three reviews this innings off successive Tim Southee deliveries in near-identical attempts to get clearly correct not out lbw decisions overturned when the star batsman was on one. Root further delighted fans who had been told they could attend the fifth day for free -- as was the case in Nottingham last week -- with an outrageous reverse-ramp six off left-arm quick Neil Wagner. Pope, whose fifty came off 66 balls, showed his class by hitting three fours off consecutive Wagner deliveries, including a superb straight drive. And with Headingley bathed in sunshine, the last over of the day saw Root complete a 78-ball fifty with a legside boundary off Bracewell. Selected ahead of Ajaz Patel, a frontline spinner, Bracewell had expensive close figures of 1-70 in 11 overs. Leach strikes Earlier, New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell had frustrated England yet again with their fourth century stand of the series before paceman Matthew Potts sparked a collapse. Leach had already secured a place in Headingley history with a memorable one not out in a dramatic one-wicket Ashes Test win over Australia at the Leeds ground in 2019. But this match has seen the 31-year-old Somerset bowler excel in his primary role of left-arm spinner. He followed a first-innings return of 5-100 with an even better 5-66 on Sunday to give him 10-166 in the 25th Test of his career. Leach polished off the tail after Potts, in his debut Test series, had made a key breakthrough by removing the in-form Mitchell lbw for 56 to end a sixth-wicket stand of 113. Mitchell, who only played in the series opener at Lord's after Henry Nicholls was sidelined, finished a campaign where he scored three hundreds with a tally of 538 runs -- the most by any overseas batsman in a series of three Tests or fewer in England When the 31-year-old was out, the Black Caps were still well-placed at 274-6, a lead of 243. Leach, however, lured Bracewell into hoisting a catch to deep midwicket before deceiving Southee with a quicker arm ball. Wagner then fell in unusual fashion when replacement wicketkeeper Sam Billings, who only took the field Sunday as a Covid-19 replacement for Ben Foakes, grabbed an edge off Leach that had lodged between his legs. When Leach bowled Boult to end the innings, Blundell was left stranded shy of what would have been his second hundred of the series on 88 not out. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"England-Bangladesh Series 2023 | The Daily Star","""After helping Bangladesh complete a series sweep over world champions England in the shortest format, top-order batter Najmul Hossain Shanto earned big gains in the T20I batting rankings. England's 3-0 defeat in their Twenty20 series in Bangladesh was a real """"eye-opener"""" for the world champions, white-ball coach Matthew Mott said. From being a constant subject of ridicule on social media to becoming the toast of the town, Najmul Hossain Shanto has seen it all. """"To finish the way we did today will leave a bit of a sour taste in our mouths but it also should act as an eye-opener for us on where we need to improve,"""" Mott said. England’s World Cup-winning skipper Jos Buttler admitted that his side were ‘outplayed’ in the three-match T20I series, in which the visitors were whitewashed by hosts Bangladesh. Bangladesh T20I and Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan admitted that one particular over from Mustafizur Rahman ‘changed the game completely’ as he talked following the Tigers’ 16-run victory in the third T20I against England at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. The last time the current world champions suffered a series whitewash in this format were in 2014 when they lost 3-0 against Australia. Bangladesh, on the other hand, enjoyed a first three-match series sweep in this format for the first time since doing the same against Ireland in 2012. Mustafizur joined the 100-wicket club in his 81st match, eclipsing Shakib Al Hasan who reached the milestone in his 84th match. Malan had scored 53 off 47 deliveries. Opener Liton Das ended a lean patch with his career-best T20I score while Najmul Hossain Shanto continued his terrific form with yet another solid knock/ as Bangladesh amassed 158 for two wickets in the third and final T20I against England in Mirpur today.

Thanks to openers Liton Das and Rony Talukdar, Bangladesh got off to a very commanding start in their third T20I against England in Mirpur today. England won the toss and elected to bowl against Bangladesh in the third T20I of the three-match series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan lauded the team's effort after Bangladesh registered a historic maiden T20I series win over the world champions England by beating the visitors by four wickets in the second of the three-match series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Sunday. Bangladesh became the only team ever to have beaten a reigning world champion in their first assignment of that particular format since the World Cup as the Shakib Al Hasan-led side clinched the three-match T20I series, with a game in hand, against the ODI and T20 World Champions England on Sunday. With the Sher-e-Bangla surface offering a lot of grip and turn for the slower bowlers, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, in for Shamim Patwary for this match, turned the screws on England with his best figures of four for 12. After being put in to bat, England lost their top four batters, including skipper Jos Buttler, for 63 in 10 overs. Four different bowlers accounted for the four dismissals at the Mirpur pitch, which looks a bit difficult to play strokes. Phil Salt led a counter-attack from England after Taskin Ahmed struck an early blow, getting rid of Dawid Malan in his second over of the first spell. A team on a winning run, or one that had just broken a losing streak, usually keep their playing eleven and tactics unchanged, and for Bangladesh it is almost always the case. """

Opener Liton Das, who redeemed himself after a string of poor performances with a match-winning 73 in the third and final T20I against England in Mirpur on Tuesday, also moved nine places up to 22, with a rating point of 566, in the batting rankings. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's left-arm seamer Mustafizur Rahman and skipper Shakib Al Hasan moved up in the T20I bowling rankings.

But in the Tiger's opening match at the ICC ODI World Cup 2023, the Bangladesh fans saw another all-rounder come to bat at one-down, hit a half-century to steady the innings following a rocky start and snap up three wickets with the ball. This '2019 Shakibesque' performance came from Mehedi Hasan Miraz. Miraz took the third wicket to fall in the Afghanistan innings, when he dismissed captain Hashmatullah Shahidi for 18, which initiated a collapse that saw the Afghans lose their remaining seven wickets for 44 runs. Miraz claimed two more wickets and finished with figures of 3-25. The right-handed batter came in to bat at one-down for the first time in his ODI career, although he had batted in that position in Bangladesh's warm-up games against Sri Lanka and England, after Tanzid Hasan got run-out. After Liton Das played a ball onto his stumps, Miraz got together with Shanto and formed a 97-run partnership for the fourth wicket which set Bangladesh on course in the 157-run chase. The 25-year-old lost his wicket after making 57 off 73 balls as Bangladesh completed the chase with six wickets to spare. Miraz was deservingly named the player of the match. Miraz is likely to get similar chances higher up the order in the tournament as the management is viewing him as an option in the top-order. It may be early to say whether Miraz, who has batted at No 7 or 8 for most of his ODI career, would replicate what Shakib did in 2019 or not. But for one match at least, Miraz conjured up a '2019 Shakibesque' performance.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Tamim ‘felt obstacles in many places’ | The Daily Star","""Tamim Iqbal, through a live Facebook video, put forth a shocking revelation yesterday. The country's best ever opening batter stated that his injury concern was not the underlying factor behind his exclusion from Bangladesh's World Cup squad. Following are the excerpts of what he said: You are all aware that I retired for a reason. Then, at the Prime Minister's request, I returned. I toiled really hard over the last two months to get in shape. Those involved, particularly the physios, would agree that there was not a single session or activity that I was requested to undertake but did not. When the [New Zealand] series approached, I wasn't happy mentally for whatever happened in the last four-five months. But when I resumed playing, I fielded for 30-35 overs. Fortunately, I was able to bat in the second match. After the game, I felt tremendously confident and mentally satisfied. I had forgotten about what had happened in the previous four or five months. I was excited to compete in the World Cup. You should expect some discomfort after recovering from an injury layoff. The same thing happened to me. I told the physio about how I felt after that game. The three selectors arrived in the dressing room at that point. I must clarify to you that not for once did I ever mention that I can't play more than five matches. I am sure even [chief selector Minhajul Abedin] Nannu cleared this yesterday. This lie was somehow fed to the media. I didn't want to create another controversy, which is why, with full honesty, I told the selectors to keep my injury in mind when selecting me. When I was assessed at the [team] hotel, they saw my pain and assessed me the next day. The most important factor is the physio report. Anyone wanting to challenge me on this, they are most welcome. My condition was described in the physio report. That I had pain after the first match and after the second match. They said if I rest for the September 26 ODI and play the second practice match before the first [World Cup] match, I would have had two weeks of rehab and complete ten weeks of overall rehab. So, I would have been in a much better position to play the first match [of the World Cup against Afghanistan]. Afterwards, the incident that happened, I don't think my injury or this lie about the five matches had any contribution for me to not go to the World Cup. I have pain but I don't have an injury. After a day or two, someone from the top level of the board, who stays very involved with us, called me. He said, you are going to the World Cup. We have to manage you. But do one thing, don't play the first match against Afghanistan. I said to him that you are talking about something that's going to happen after 12 or 13 days. I will be in good condition by then. Why won't I be playing? He said that if you play, we are planning that you will bat down the order. You have to consider my mindset at that moment. I had played a good innings. I was happy. Now all this talk suddenly. It was hard for me to take. I have been playing for 17 years in the same position. I have never batted at No. 3 or 4. I have no experience of batting in the middle-order. So, naturally, I didn't take this conversation well. I felt that I was being forced to face obstacles in many places. I said if you have this mindset, then don't send me to the World Cup. I don't want to be in this nastiness. Overall, I think, if you really want me, then you should make me mentally free and happy. I am coming out of a very bad three, four months. It was a tough time for me. Perhaps, if all this was presented to me differently, maybe I would have reacted differently. Perhaps, I would have accepted it. But suddenly someone calls you and says, don't play, or if they are saying that sending you down the order is the plan, I am not too sure how fair it is. You are seeing a lot of things happening. One story may be an isolated incident, two stories may be a misunderstanding. But if there are seven-eight stories with someone in three-four months, then it is intentional. At the end of the day, I will wish the very best to the fifteen who have gone [to the World Cup]. I hope they will bring success to Bangladesh. One more thing, please keep me in mind, everyone. Don't forget me. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"‘Nasty game, not injury, behind my exclusion’ | The Daily Star","""A day after being excluded from the World Cup squad on fitness grounds, Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal said that a nasty game, not injury concerns, played a key role in his last-minute omission. In a video statement on his Facebook page, the left-hander also claimed that a lot of lies circulated in the media to obscure the truth. He said that he never declined to play the third one-dayer against New Zealand on Tuesday, nor did he say anything about being available for five World Cup games as reported. Things were set in motion after a Monday midnight meeting between coach Chandika Hathurusingha and captain Shakib Al Hasan at board president Nazmul Hassan's residence, where Shakib reportedly said he would not captain the side if unfit players were selected. The Daily Star reached out to the Bangladesh Cricket Board, but nobody wanted to speak on the matter. In a 12-minute-plus recorded statement, posted after the national team's departure for India at around 4:00pm, Tamim said that nowhere in the latest medical report did it say that he was unfit for the World Cup. The medical report even detailed Tamim's injury management leading up to the first World Cup game against Afghanistan on October 7, according to Tamim. The crux of the problem was a telephone conversation with a top board official, during the course of which the left-hander was asked to bat down the order and sit out the first World Cup game. While baring his soul, the most successful Bangladesh opener said: """"In the last two or three days, what has happened and what was written is completely different from what actually happened."""" Narrating the events since his return to national team for the New Zealand series, he said: """"You all know I announced my retirement (on July 6 this year) and there was a reason for it. I returned at the request of the prime minister. Tamim, who is carrying a recurring back injury, said he worked very hard for the past two months to get fit. """"Those who were involved in the process, physios and trainers, will all agree that there was no session or exercise that they wanted me to do which I did not comply with,"""" he said. He said the New Zealand series was a real test for him to see how his fitness had improved. After missing the chance in the first game due to rain, Tamim scored a fluent 44 in the second match. """"After that game I was very happy mentally. I was looking forward to playing again and I was looking forward to the World Cup,"""" said the 34-year-old batter. He said that the pain was still there after both games and that he had informed the physio and the selectors about it. """"I want to clear one thing: I never at any moment or time said that I would not be able to play more than five matches (in the World Cup). I don't know who fed this lie to media or how. """"What I told the selectors is that my body would be like this. Pain will be there. So, when you select the team, keep that in mind,"""" he said, adding that he communicated it in good faith to avoid another controversy such as the one during the Afghanistan series, when it was circulated in the media that if someone is not fit, he should not play. """"I was surprised at that time because I played that game (first ODI against Afghanistan) after agreement with the coach and physio."""" He said he would challenge anyone regarding his current medical report, which he claimed to have seen. The report said if Tamim was rested for the third ODI against New Zealand and played the second warm-up game in India on October 2, then he would have completed his 10-week rehabilitation. """"Nowhere in the report was it said that I would not be able to play more than five games. """"I don't think injury played a big role in my exclusion from the World Cup. I have pain but I'm not injured,"""" he stressed. When told to bat down the order or sit out games, Tamim responded: """"I told him that we have another 12-13 days and that I would be in good condition by then. Why won't I play?"""" Tamim said that such incidents made him feel that someone was intentionally putting obstacles in his path to dishearten him. """"What I said to him is that if you have such a plan then don't send me to World Cup. I don't want to be part of this nasty thing,"""" Tamim said, adding had those terms been presented differently, his reaction perhaps would have been different. """"I'm not sure how fair it is,"""" he said, adding that one or two episodes can be a misunderstanding, but when seven episodes happen to one cricketer in the last three or four months, it is done intentionally.

"The Tamim-Shakib fiasco and Bangladesh’s prospects at the World Cup | The Daily Star","""On Friday, after Mehedi Hasan Miraz came out for the toss for Bangladesh's warm-up match against Sri Lanka in Guwahati, naturally the viewers started to wonder where Shakib Al Hasan was. The broadcasters said that Shakib had apparently hurt his ankle the previous day while training and wouldn't be taking part in the warm-up game. The seriousness of his injury wasn't clarified initially, which allowed the rumour mill to start churning out speculations. The news of Shakib being ruled out for Bangladesh's World Cup opener against Afghanistan on October 7 spread on social media like wildfire. This news should have hit the Bangladesh fans like a thunderbolt. But the reaction to the news was mixed to say the least. Many fans reacted to the news as if divine justice had struck to correct the wrong that had occurred a few days earlier. A little while later, when it was revealed that Shakib had only suffered a minor niggle, it was now the turn of Shakib fanatics to rejoice and they did so by mocking the 'rival fans' for their premature celebration. This divide among the fans has been the byproduct of the mudslinging between two of the country's biggest sporting icons – Shakib and Tamim Iqbal. The seeds of the clash were sown long ago. Their frosty relationship was an open secret for many years and became public knowledge after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon declared it to the world in an interview. The retirement-unretirement saga of Tamim, him stepping down as captain and Shakib returning as the ODI skipper – they were all small tremors leading up to the earthquake that shook Bangladesh cricket just days before the World Cup. Tamim, the country's leading run-scorer in all formats, had been left out of the World Cup squad. The opener, however, claimed that he wasn't snubbed but had actually told a highly influential member of the board to leave him out of the squad as he didn't want to be part of the 'nasty games' being played against him in a heated conversation over the phone. Whether Tamim was left out or he took himself out, the end result remains the same: Tamim is not going to play in the World Cup for Bangladesh. With that in mind, the most important question going forward is where does it leave the Bangladesh team ahead of the World Cup? Well, the brief answer is, not in a great spot. A quick look at the 15-man squad shows that Bangladesh have gone in with a bowling-heavy squad. For the first time ever, the Tigers have selected five specialist pacers in the World Cup – Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and Tanzim Hasan Sakib. There are also four spin bowling options, a couple of left-armers in Shakib and Nasum Ahmed and the duo of right-arm off-spinners in Mehedi and Mahedi Hasan. Liton Das and the young Tanzid Hasan Tamim are the two frontline opening batters in the squad. The selectors took the gutsy call of not taking a back-up opener as they are depending on Mehedi to come good as the makeshift opener when called upon. Najmul Hossain Shanto is Bangladesh's most in-form batter heading into the World Cup. The southpaw averages a shade below 50 in ODIs in 2023 at a strike rate of 86.92 and his performances at No.3 will be pivotal for Bangladesh. The middle-order of Shakib, Towhid Hridoy and Mushfiqur Rahim is Bangladesh's strongest point in the batting order. When these three are not busy repairing the innings after an all-too-familiar top-order collapse, they have the ability to make up for Bangladesh's glaring lack of firepower at No.7. The veteran Mahmudullah has also made his comeback months after many had written the epitaph of his ODI career and could occupy the vacant No.7 spot. But from what Shakib and coach Chandika Hathurusingha have said in the build-up to the tournament, it can be assumed that Bangladesh are likely to adopt the horses for courses approach, making changes in personnel and batting positions based on opposition and condition. An honest comparison between Bangladesh and the other competing teams in the tournament also doesn't present a rosy picture for the Tigers. The fact that the tournament is being played in a round-robin format is also not helpful for a team like Bangladesh as it means that one or two big wins won't be enough to progress to the next stage. At the very least, they need more victories than defeats. There is no reason to think that Bangladesh's fortunes would have looked radically better had Tamim been picked. But the drama leading up to his exclusion and the ugly spat that followed has divided the country's cricket fans. Shakib will have the team of his desire at his disposal in the World Cup. The process of achieving that squad, however, was questionable to say the least. Now it's up to the skipper to deliver on his promise and make this Bangladesh's best ever World Cup. Given the chaos leading up to the World Cup and the terrible precedent set by Shakib and Tamim, anything short of that will be unacceptable. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"England's whitewash in Bangladesh an 'eye-opener' | The Daily Star","""England's 3-0 defeat in their Twenty20 series in Bangladesh was a real """"eye-opener"""" for the world champions, white-ball coach Matthew Mott said. Bangladesh secured a 16-run victory in Mirpur on Tuesday to complete the whitewash and Mott said England would have to learn from it. """"We really wanted to finish well here. I think it's been a fantastic tour in terms of what we've been up against, a very strong home team,"""" Mott said. """"That one hurts. To finish the way we did will leave a bit of a sour taste in our mouths. It should act as a real eye-opener on where we need to improve."""" England were short on batters for the series after Tom Abell and Will Jacks were forced to withdraw due to injuries, and Mott defended the decision to not call up replacements. """"There was a realisation that we were probably better off investing in some batters here and putting them under pressure in these games. You only learn from your mistakes,"""" Mott added. """"The opportunities they were given here will give them time to reflect and when we get into pressure situations in World Cups, I am confident that it will have been the right decision."""" However, former England captain Nasser Hussain suggested they were looking too far ahead to the 50-overs Cricket World Cup, which will take place in India in October and November. """"I see what they're trying to do, but the short-term view and the long-term view, you've always got to balance that as a selector ...,"""" Hussain told Sky Sports.

"How Jos Buttler has assumed the leadership mantle from Eoin Morgan | The Daily Star","""Jos Buttler's record as a captain in ICC limited overs tournaments is unblemished, having led England to ICC Men's T20 World Cup glory in 2022. That was his first campaign in charge, and now the hard-hitting middle-order batter will look to add one-day success to his T20 crown when England try to retain their title in India. After the retirement of Eoin Morgan, who brought the team together in such impressive fashion on home soil in 2019, Buttler was an obvious candidate to take over in both forms of white-ball cricket. In a side that was typified by its attacking approach and desire to dictate matches, who better than the team's most destructive batter to lead from the front? So far, Buttler has flourished with the captaincy. His record with the bat as skipper in T20 cricket is marginally better than without the captain's armband. The difference is starker in ODIs. From an already impressive average of 40.67, Buttler's average jumps to 45.21 when given the added responsibility of leading the side. That has been perhaps the most important development of the Buttler reign. As arguably England's most important player, it was crucial that he continue to deliver with the bat. Captain or not, Buttler is capable of winning games on his own. His 11 ODI hundreds are the most of any active player who bats at No.4 or lower, with nine of those hundreds coming in victories. If Morgan was the federator, Buttler leads by example. His fearless approach to the game embodies this England side. He has not been part of the Bazball revolution in Test cricket, and yet England's red-ball strategy seems inspired by Buttler's dominating approach when facing the white ball. And when it comes to the biggest stage, Buttler delivers time and again. He was England's top run-scorer at both the ICC Men's T20 World Cups in 2021 and 2022, while four years ago he saved his most important innings for the final at Lord's, making 59 as he and Ben Stokes put on 110 for the fifth wicket that allowed England to rebuild and take the match to a Super Over. The one anomaly in his ODI record is how he has fared in India to date. Curiously, in eight matches on Indian soil, he has managed just 83 runs at an average of under 12. On the surface, that would appear to be a concern heading into the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 which will be hosted entirely in India. Take a step back, however, and those worries begin to evaporate. Firstly, because Buttler has had no such struggles in Indian conditions in T20 cricket, averaging 42.60 for England. And secondly, because he has established himself as one of the greatest overseas performers in the Indian Premier League in recent years. Only Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle have more IPL hundreds than Buttler, who has been a mainstay for Rajasthan Royals at the top of the order. So if conditions are not an issue, it would appear more to be a quirk of a small sample size that has seen Buttler struggle in ODIs in India to this point. With such a single-minded drive and a daring approach to the game, there is no reason why Buttler should not turn that record around over the course of the next month and a half. That will all start against New Zealand in Ahmedabad in the opener on October 5. Four years on from playing a key part in England getting the better of the Black Caps to lift the trophy for the first time, expect Buttler to lead from the front as they attempt to defend their title. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket","""Heightened security measures around high-profile sporting events could become the norm, according to the England and Wales Cricket Board's respected security advisor Reg Dickason. England's trip to Bangladesh was only given the go-ahead after Dickason was assured the tourists would be given presidential levels of security, three months after a terrorist attack in Dhaka that resulted in the deaths of 29 people, reports BT Sport. Their hosts have emphatically delivered with England's team hotels in both Dhaka and Chittagong heavily fortified with armed guards inside and outside the complex, while they have a 'ring of steel' security presence en route to the stadiums. This summer's European Championship in France and the Olympic Games in Rio have seen increased levels of security in an effort to thwart would-be terrorists. And Dickason believes these protection measures will become increasingly more prevalent in future. He told the Mail on Sunday: """"Historically, people thought sport was exempt from terrorist threat but that's certainly proved not to be the case in recent years. It's certainly not exempt. Awareness is heightened because of recent events all around the world. """"The levels of security we are seeing now around sport will be the norm. I think that levels of security are going to continue this way. """"All sporting bodies see the issues it is going to cause if something happens and they know that if there is an attack, it affects morale. It affects morale in the countries where these attacks take place. It affects tourism. The whole lot. """"The problems we are facing globally insist that we up the level of security for sporting events and any large gathering. Potential attackers are looking for something that gives immediate global impact and sport certainly does that."""" Despite the levels of protection granted to England, limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan and opening batsman Alex Hales opted to miss the tour due to security fears. Those are the only two absentees, however, and several have gone on record to express their complete faith in Dickason's opinion. Asked whether the responsibility weighs on him, he said: """"I guess it does but it is certainly more a process thing than a Reg thing. """"All sports organisations have got people that are in charge of security and I happen to be in charge of England cricket.

"'Firstly, thank you England' | The Daily Star","""Oh! If only Mustafizur Rahman was here. It is but natural that the magical pacer will be dearly missed when the Tigers embark on another big challenge at home today. Although the new-look Bangladesh team negates the dependence on any particular player, the cricket crazy fans of the country have been so engrossed with one mystical performance after another from the 21-year-old right-armer from Satkhira that everyone will miss watching Fizz in what would have been his first battle with England. However, that disappointment will have to stay on the sidelines as there is a broader significance to this series. Roughly eight hours before a winner is decided in the first of three ODIs in Mirpur today, cricket will already have won a bigger contest when Bangladesh take the field against the visiting England side at 2:30pm. Whether the visitors win or lose, they deserve plaudits in advance as it was the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and its players who upheld the spirit of the game by confirming their visit, overcoming all security fears and thereby winning the hearts of the millions of cricket fans in the country. That is the reason Bangladesh ODI and T20I captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza did not miss the opportunity to thank England at the pre-match press conference in Mirpur yesterday. """"First of all I would like to thank the England team and ECB obviously,"""" the skipper said. For Bangladesh there will be many things to prove in the three-match ODI and two-match Test series. So far, the organisers have left no stone unturned in ensuring maximum security for the visitors and a successful ending will be a huge message to the world. It is a series where we can again prove how loving we are towards our guests, something we have earlier proven on a number of occasions. And when it comes to the battle over 22 yards, there are also many challenges which the Mashrafe-led team will need to overcome if they want to show the world that 2015 was no fluke. Instead they will demonstrate that they are on the right path -- especially in their favoured 50-over format -- to becoming a major force in world cricket. During a marathon press conference the Tigers skipper probably best described what was waiting in the upcoming matches as he showed full respect to his opponents, branding them as one of the best ODI teams at the moment. However, he also exuded full confidence in his side and said he was anticipating a good battle throughout the series. """"Obviously it will be difficult to say who the favourites are. The series will be competitive,"""" was the simple equation from the brave-heart cricketer, under whom Bangladesh have achieved one success after another. As has now become customary, Mashrafe emphasised the importance of the first match of the series. The home team can take a lot of inspiration from their recent encounters against England, especially their memorable World Cup win in Adelaide last year, but Mashrafe was not ready to go down memory lane. Instead, he wanted to take the series as a fresh start for his side and he considers this the biggest challenge to his team as they aim to prove that they are consistent and have the ability to win series against England after dispatching Pakistan, India and South Africa at home in the recent past. """"I think we beat England in Australia in the World Cup about one-and-a-half-years back and after that England have changed. They have played like a champion team if you look at their performances,"""" he said, lavishing praise on his opponents and adding that they were still a good team despite the absence of a few regular players. On the other hand, if someone wants to bring up statistics in favour of England, which show that they have won 13 ODIs out of 16 against Bangladesh, Mashrafe will simply tell you: """"We are now playing good cricket. Our main target is to be consistent in our performances."""" And at a time when there has been a lot of talk about what kind of pitch would be best to thwart England, Mashrafe's observation in this regard reflected the truly positive mindset of the team. """"If you have followed Bangladesh wickets for the last two years it hasn't turned as much. We played on quite sporting wickets and our batsmen have batted really well. I think you cannot just focus on spinners or pacers. As far as my team is concerned I can say that our whole department is playing really well so I think we rely on all the departments. When we played against South Africa on a slow wicket we struggled in the first one-day but after that there was a good wicket. I believe that if it's difficult for us it will be difficult for them as well."""" As things stand, all cricket fans can look forward to an exciting battle and the success of cricket over the next few weeks. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

The mission of the drill was to save the so-called hostages, played by other Para Commandos, from the England dressing room at the main ground. The Para Commandos charged into the main ground, performed a mock shooting drill and then took the hostages back to the helicopter at the national cricket academy.

"7-4-2 rule weighing up Taskin and Co’s workload | The Daily Star","""""""Bhai, don't say anything,"""" one cricketer requested as he and a few members of the national team came off their running exercise, sensing that the query was regarding the intense weather. Fatigue was vividly written across his face. The weather has been intense for the past week and yesterday afternoon, it 'felt' like 47 degrees. In this intense heat, load management will be key for the BCB and they felt that the changes they were making would make a difference. """"We will have to play a Test match in this weather so it is about preparing,"""" selector Habibul Bashar told The Daily Star. Heading to a World Cup and given the heat, managing the pacers' workload is pivotal. So how does the BCB's current load management system work? """"It's a software-based program. Either the players or the ones supervising them inputs the data. It is especially used for pace bowlers. It has existed for a number of years but the software has been updated. We input the number of overs a bowler has sent down in a day. The basic rule we use is the seven-four-two rule. It means in seven days, you can bowl four days and you can't bowl for more than two days on the trot,"""" BCB chief physician Debashish Chowdhury told The Daily Star. Red and green are the colour codes used, with red suggesting a player has either exceeded his workload or has had an inadequate workload within a given timeframe while green means a player has fulfilled their optimal number of overs before a match. Taskin, who is still in recovery mode following an injury, had not bowled a day before yesterday, in accordance with the seven-four-two rule. Will the same standards be used for every player?

""""If you have to bowl in a Test, you have to carry a certain workload. If you don't have the optimal numbers, you could be in trouble. If the workload is high, there is also a risk. Taskin is fully fit medically, but he has not had enough of a workload and bowled optimally, so maybe he won't reach optimum numbers before the Afghanistan Test. There could be a risk but the coach is there to take the decision on his inclusion,"""" Debashish said. GPS trackers are being introduced from the Afghanistan series. """"It is also a load management tool, used to see how much a player is moving. We haven't used it before. We have foreign staff who are overseeing these technologies. Due to that, we are also ensuring our own staff is not being overworked. We didn't have these documentations like Australia or England did before,"""" he added. What remains to be seen now is whether Taskin reaches his optimal workload requirement. He had been sought out to play the County Championship season for Yorkshire County but did not want to go, BCB cricket operations chairman Jalal Yunus informed yesterday. """"He was talking to us but with the World Cup coming up, both parties decided it would be better not to play for now,"""" Jalal said. """"Yes, it was done with workload in mind.

Taskin, who will feature for Bulawayo Braves in the Zim-Afro T10 League, picked up two wickets against Afghanistan in the second T20I on Sunday as Bangladesh won the series 2-0. Mushfiqur, on the other hand, was directly signed by Joburg Buffaloes. Taskin and Mushfiqur are the only two cricketers from Bangladesh to play in the league. Earlier, following the completion of Bangladesh's 2-0 win in their two-match T20I series against Afghanistan in Sylhet, Taskin and Shakib took a lift on Afghanistan star Rashid Khan's chartered flight right after the final game on Sunday. Rashid was supposed to fly to the United States to take part in the Major League Cricket (MLC), with his side, MI New York, sending the chartered flight to fly the cricketer to the USA. Alongside Shakib, Liton Das will also feature in the Global T20 League in Canada, for which the right-handed opener had already left the country on Tuesday.

"World Cup first, job second for young Bangladeshi fan | ICC ODI World Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","""Usually, only the employers exercise the right to add conditions before offering a job. The job seekers don't get to give conditions, at least not in Bangladesh. In that sense, Bangladesh cricket fan Fahim Rahman definitely stands out. He had joined his current workplace two years ago on the condition that he would be granted a 40-day leave to watch the cricket World Cup in 2023. This reporter chatted with Fahim in Dharamshala on Saturday. His love of cricket has brought him to this picturesque mountainous region, 2500 kilometres from Dhaka. He will stay in India throughout the World Cup. He will proudly wave the Bangladesh fan and see Shakib Al Hasan and Co in action. Even when the Tigers play in some remote corners of the world, some Bangladeshi supporters always turn up to watch them play live. In comparison, the city of Dharamshala at Himachal Pradesh is not too far. Still, the delays in obtaining an Indian visa, the arduous nature of the journey and managing personal matters make this lengthy trip a very difficult one. During Bangladesh's match against Afghanistan, there were many Bangladeshi fans at the stands and all of them had a story to tell about their journey. But among them, Fahim's story stood out. Fahim is a software engineer employed in Dhaka. He regularly turns up at the stadium to watch Bangladesh play at home. This is the first time he has gone abroad to watch the Tigers play and he had planned this trip well in advance. """"I've been watching matches from the ground since 2012. I've watched 30-40 matches till now. I've always watched matches at home, never gone abroad for a match. When it was announced that the 2023 World Cup will be played in India, I thought to myself that as this was happening in the neighbouring country, so I must go and see the World Cup,"""" Fahim said. When Fahim made the decision, he was still a student. But he didn't let go of his dream when he joined the workforce. """"Two years ago, I joined Vivasoft Ltd as a software engineer.

That's when I told them that during the 2023 World Cup, I would require a 30-40-day vacation. Seeing my craze for cricket, they accepted my condition,"""" Fahim said. """"I got more and more anxious as the World Cup drew closer. I had applied for a visa three months ago. But everything was moving at such a slow pace that even a month ago I thought I wouldn't be able to go to India.""""  Another Bangladeshi cricket fan, Mahfuz Siddique Himalay, plans to visit 18 Indian cities on this tour. He will watch five matches of the Bangladesh team from the stands and spend the rest of his trip observing the Indian culture, heritage, history and architecture. He will write about it on social media and also author a book on his tour. His well-wishers came up with the funds for his 46-day trip. He posted on Facebook for support for his tour to India, which got a tremendous response. Mahfuz was present in the gallery during the match against Afghanistan; he will also be present for the England game. However, he is more intrigued by the drama of cricket than the result. His eyes search for characters on the cricket field. The majority of the Bangladeshi fans in Dharamshala are students, who came from different regions in India. Punjab University's student Raihan feels that more people from Bangladesh would've come had the process to obtain the visa been less complicated. """"Actually, many people I know were supposed to come, but they couldn't due to the delays in the visa application process. Hopefully, more people will be present for the next matches.""""

"Hridoy’s bat swings freely in T20 team’s changing fortunes | The Daily Star","""The kind of bat speed Tawhid Hridoy generates has already been a telling factor since his introduction to international cricket. At the highest level, however, technique and mentality are opposite sides of the same coin. Hridoy showed he can stand up to such situations while having that clarity of mind in the first T20I against Afghanistan on Friday. The targeting of specific bowlers was the plan and Hridoy executed. The way he picked off Azmatullah Omarzai over backward square-leg for a six in the second T20I is the kind of display now changing how the Tigers can approach the shortest format. Replying to a question about that particular shot, the 22-year-old gave the idea of freeness. """"It's normal. When the ball arrived, my body automatically went for it,"""" he told The Daily Star in an interview yesterday. """"Yes maybe no one here has played it before but they have started and slowly they will play these kinds of shots more,"""" he was confident the mindset is changing. That kind of confidence is also now rubbing off, transforming Bangladesh with each shot he plays. Yet, younger players are often found wanting at the big stage. Hridoy wants to go a different way and play such scenarios more frequently. """"In T20s, the matches fluctuate a lot and it's important to execute. I feel that any batter able to chase in such a game would get a big confidence boost. These kinds of scenarios don't arrive frequently. I would want every batter to bat in such situations because then they will get the confidence,"""" he affirmed. While Fazalhaq Farooqi has been the pick of the bowlers in the recently concluded series, Hridoy kept his calm to read the scenario, knowing that the whole attack was quality. """"It doesn't matter to me whether it's spin or pace. Rashid Khan, Mujeeb [Ur Rehman] and [Mohammad] Nabi are very good bowlers. In T20s it's important to target one or two bowlers from the opposition. We also planned for the match in that way. """"Our plan, not only speaking of Farooqi or Omarzai, was that it was a better option to go for their pacers rather than their spinners. It's about the calculative risks you take according to various match scenarios. If the situation had demanded that we would have to take on Rashid khan, then we would have tried to take him on too,"""" he underlined. Even during his brief international career, he has falsely been tagged as a leg-side oriented player. """"Many are saying that I am hitting through one zone only but it's not like that.

It's best to not keep fear within yourself. What will happen? Maybe I will play badly or the team will lose or maybe I will be dropped. What more can happen?

"Of friendship, bitterness and uneasy circumstances | The Daily Star","""Both Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan made their debuts in close proximity. Tamim was the first to enter the ODI format, Shakib coming in just a few months later. Shakib had debuted first in Tests, ahead of Tamim, who debuted in 2008. In friendship, the two of the big and young characters of Bangladesh cricket took the team to new heights. In their split, it is as if a broken mirror now shows the muddy atmosphere of the cricket fraternity. Tamim and Shakib were the aggressors, the assets of our cricket that bled new life into the country's cricket. Two youngsters who knew how to stare down the opposition came together and combined to deliver and take Bangladesh to new heights. They were known as best friends, and as individuals they publicly fawned over their bond as well. They even banked on each other's merits, with many a partnership where the duo showed how they thrived alongside each other. All good things come to an end though. Even in the gentleman's game, things that happen inside the dressing room and in personal conversations can create a bitter rift. A broken relationship like theirs is not the first in world cricket, nor will it be the last. It has reportedly been a few years since they talked as 'just friends.' While their uneasy relationship may have been an open secret to many, the news had stayed out of the public's ears until this year, when BCB president Nazmul Hassan, in an explosive interview, exposed the strained relationship, bringing the issue to the forefront of Bangladesh cricket. """"This is not a healthy dressing room, that I can guarantee you. This thing [rift between Shakib and Tamim], it's not that I have not tried to sort it out. I spoke with both of them but I felt that it would not be easy to settle the issue at the moment,"""" the BCB president had said. Shakib, amongst other qualities, is recognised as someone who can compartmentalise his emotions and focus on bringing out the best of his game, no matter the mental strain he is facing off the field. For Tamim, the scenario became increasingly difficult as the ODI captain as talks of a divided dressing room continued. The team was left to cater to both big-hearted characters, but it brought out a pressure Tamim may not have felt before. Amidst the lack of runs and recurring injury issues that Tamim faced recently, the very public knowledge of his strained relationship with his friend became an issue. There were whispers of a change of ODI captaincy and zero transparency, brought along by the remarks from the board president. It in the end effected Tamim and as far as BCB's ways of dealing with senior stars go, it was another ugly mark on the country's cricket. As administrators, they needed to solve their issues internally and gather both their forces for the upcoming World Cup in India.

"Let the noise subside | The Daily Star","""Ahead of the two white-ball series against England, all the noise in the media related to the captains of the two respective formats, ODI skipper Tamim Iqbal and T20I counterpart Shakib Al Hasan, not being on talking terms. The information presented to the media was that there was an unhealthy environment in the dressing room. But although the ODI series was lost 2-1, the team blocked out the noise and staged a comeback in the T20Is with a 3-0 whitewash. The difference in all four wins was a change in body language, especially against an England side that have been enjoying a purple patch, not just from a results perspective but also in terms of their brand of cricket. Their aggressive mentality has seamlessly translated across formats and left an impact that has proven difficult to contain in any condition. Although the Tigers were expected to perform better in the ODIs, it was in the T20Is that they showed a new energy. That change was facilitated by some new cricketers in the line-up, those who did not appear to carry the fear or baggage of failure and emboldened by how Shakib communicated with them. Mehedi Hasan Miraz yesterday said that all the cricketers were playing their best cricket. """"We didn't care about the results. We tried to figure out how to implement the process and stay with the process,"""" he said. Overall, the team combination was good and we won because everyone played their best cricket,"""" he added. The batting, bowling and fielding all left an impression in the T20Is, a change from the ODIs where the batting and especially fielding accentuated the need for major improvement. It was all the more unexpected since the T20I team was full of faces who are yet to settle into the international arena. The likes of Towhid Hridoy and Rony Talukdar showed their mettle, having performed in the domestic circuit for a number of years, while Najmul Hossain Shanto and Hasan Mahmud continued to gain a foothold. After the game, it could be surmised that Shakib had kept things simple in the dressing room. There were no expectations from the three departments, only plans. """"We didn't dream of it, but we also didn't put ourselves under pressure before the series. We didn't talk about winning games. We just wanted to play good cricket,"""" he had remarked. Thus, Hridoy and Rony played their shots, Hasan got a yorker in during an important stage of the second T20I to go with stellar death-bowling in the first game and Shanto struck runs in all three T20Is. The important thing for Shakib was peformances in the recent BPL, where good wickets challenged bowlers and batters carried confidence into national set-up. """"Everyone in this [T20I] team performed in this year's BPL. It wasn't too long before the England tour. The top five-six batters in this series were also the top run-getters in the BPL. It is the same for the highest wicket-takers. The confidence did carry over,"""" Shakib had said on Tuesday. The importance was placed in players expressing themselves and the management counted on them. However, Chandika Hathurusingha had started his first spell with success in 2014. If Bangladesh are to continue in this vein, the noise from the BCB hierarchy regarding players needs to subside so they do not carry fear of failure into series. Ahead of every series, there is talk of lack of leg-spin options, batting-order deficiencies and not being able to put up 180-plus scores in T20Is. If providing good pitches in the BPL can lead to a 3-0 sweep of England in a format where the Tigers have often been found wanting, it indeed is time to focus on domestic cricket and fixing such issues instead of talking about individuals. Let the noise subside, so performance in international cricket does not become the issue. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Race against time before World Cup delight | Bangladesh vs Afghanistan 3rd Match | The Daily Star","""The lengthy process to obtain the visa, the race against time to reach the venue and the many annoying obstacles along the way felt worth it after getting to see the Bangladesh team begin their campaign in the ICC ODI World Cup with a dominating win. The rollercoaster ride began right from when this reporter applied for an Indian visa, which finally got granted on October 5 - the same day the World Cup began. The next challenge was to reach the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala, the venue of the Tigers' opening match of the World Cup, in time. With no direct flights available to Dharamshala from Dhaka, this reporter and a colleague from the office had no other choice but to take a flight to Delhi on October 6 and then go to Dharamshala by road. After reaching Delhi in the afternoon, me and my colleague had to rush to the intercity bus station, hop on a bus and complete an 11-hour-long overnight journey to reach the picturesque city of Dharamshala.  There was no time to enjoy the breathtaking natural beauty of the city as we had to rush towards the stadium right after checking in to the hotel as there was about an hour to go before the Tigers begin their World Cup campaign. It took about another 30 minutes or so to complete the formalities with the ICC officials to get the accreditation card to enter the venue. The aim was to reach the venue before the toss. But by the time we finally stepped inside the press box, the Tigers were already dominating Afghanistan courtesy of a double blow from skipper Shakib Al Hasan. The hassle to reach the venue left me huffing, puffing and sweating all over. Still, it was satisfying to see Bangladeshi bowlers bundling out Afghanistan for just 156 runs and then the batters completing the chase successfully to give the Tigers a winning start to their World Cup campaign. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Wary Tigers seek high ground | The Daily Star","""With an aim to reach a higher pedestal, the second group of the Bangladesh national cricket team, including limited-overs captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Mahmudullah Riyad and a host of others, left for Australia yesterday night. While the first group of players, including Test skipper Mushfiqur Rahim and a number of players who were done with their Bangladesh Premier League commitments, left on November 8, the remaining cricketers caught the Singapore Airlines flight last night, which left at around 10 pm. The 23-member team will spend two weeks in Australia, preparing for their tour of New Zealand. The tour will begin on December 26 with an ODI series. Bangladesh will play three ODIs, three T20Is and two Tests within the next one month. Prior to their departure, the common sentiment among the players was that of caution. While they were no doubt confident about the series, they do not want to overplay expectations this time. Take for instance the case of Tamim Iqbal. The left-hander is generally an avid talker prior to any series. He often speaks about targeting centuries and other landmarks, this time though the star opener was not too keen to express himself before the New Zealand series. Speaking to The Daily Star yesterday, the left-hander said: “If you must write something, then just ask everyone to pray for us. Hopefully we will do well. Other than that, I don't really want to say anything. Let's see how it goes.” Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, who had spoken to reporters on Friday morning, said that the tour would be difficult but that his team are ready for the challenge. “The quicker we adjust to conditions over there, the better for us. It's going to be difficult but I am sure we can take good memories from the wins that we have had at home in the last two years. Playing away from home is a new challenge and hopefully we can do well,” he had said. Mashrafe's deputy in limited overs cricket, Shakib Al Hasan, had a similar message and hoped for a good start. When asked about his thoughts regarding the New Zealand series after the final of the BPL on Friday, he said: “We will be playing in new conditions. We will be going out after a long time and it will be a big challenge for us. Hopefully the camp in Australia will help us. We need to start the series well. If we can start the ODI series well, then I believe we can do well throughout the series.” Mahmudullah Riyad, the player of the tournament of the recently concluded BPL was a bit more positive. He reckons that this was a good time to play New Zealand. Riyad's positive mindset might be based on the fact that he had a brilliant time in Australia and New Zealand during the World Cup in 2015. In fact, it's not just Riyad; quite a few Bangladesh players have recorded their best numbers against New Zealand. Take for instance Mominul Haque. The left-hander averages a staggering 188 in two Tests against New Zealand and he has two centuries including his highest score of 181 against them. Shakib's best bowling figures in a Test innings, seven for 36, was against the Kiwis. Rubel Hossain has a hattrick against New Zealand in ODIs and has recorded figures of six for 26 against the Kiwis. All these numbers, of course, were recorded at home. Away from home, Bangladesh lost all seven of their ODIs and sole Test against New Zealand. The last time they played a bilateral series in New Zealand was back in 2010 when they lost the ODIs 3-0 and the Test series 1-0. On the whole, Bangladesh have beaten New Zealand in eight ODIs and have lost 17. They will however take heart from the fact that they have beaten New Zealand seven out of eight times in the last five years. Having set a brilliant record at home, the Tigers now hope they can replicate their performance abroad. As Mashrafe put it on Friday, even the most prominent sides struggle abroad and from that perspective, it is going to be very difficult for Bangladesh. While that is the harsh reality, the country's cricket fraternity hopes that the men in green can take inspiration from their two-week camp in Australia and further break landmarks. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Camp in Australia will be crucial: Mashrafe | The Daily Star","""After having aced a number of challenges at home, the Bangladesh national cricket team will embark upon a new challenge from the end of this month when they begin their tour of New Zealand. Bangladesh ODI and T20I skipper Mashrafe Bin Mortaza described the new challenge as difficult, but one that the Tigers were confident about. “Two years ago we had targeted to win 80 per cent of our matches at home and by the grace of God we have managed to achieve that target. Now it's a different challenge to play outside home. Even established teams find it difficult to win away from home and from that aspect, it's a bigger challenge for us. “In addition, the weather in New Zealand is very different from other places. It's going to be difficult. But we can take the momentum with us. We can take the good memories that we have into the tour of New Zealand. If we can do that, then that will give us confidence. Hopefully the practice session in Australia will give us more confidence,” explained Mashrafe during a press conference at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur yesterday morning. Before going to New Zealand, the Tigers will be spending around two weeks in Australia in order to prepare for the series. A section of the national team left for Australia on Thursday, while another group including the likes of Mashrafe, Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah Riyad will leave today. Mashrafe believes that Bangladesh's preparatory camp in Australia will be extremely useful for the national team. “The entire national team will be living there together. We will live like a family and we will have the liberty to openly discuss our problems. It will make it easier to work. It has worked before. “For example, the 15-day camp we had in Australia before the World Cup in 2015 helped us a lot. The camps we had in Khulna and Chittagong before the World T20 helped us overcome the first round of the ICC World Twenty20. That round was dangerous,” explained Mashrafe. “In addition, we will be working on the technical details of how to bowl or bat in those conditions and also try to review the conditions over there. Honestly speaking I think all the three departments over there will be challenging. The wickets over there can offer 350 runs. We need to adjust to that. “The biggest challenge will be to adjust to the wind. The faster we can adjust to all of this, the better. At home, even if we make a mistake, we are able to recover. I don't think we will get that opportunity over there,” he added. Despite the difficulties, Mashrafe was confident that his team's new brand of cricket and different mindset would help them conquer the Kiwis. “We are in a new situation. We have a different mindset now. We have the confidence to do well no matter where we play. At least that's what people expect. We will definitely try to win, but it will be difficult,” he said. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket: Pace hopes head down under","""It will be a special moment indeed when Bangladesh's two most promising young pacers Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed pair up in conditions such as those in New Zealand. It will be nothing short of a dream if the duo also bowls in the Test series. However, when the two bowlers left for Australia among the first batch of the 22-member preliminary squad, the team management and fans will only pray that one will regain full fitness for his return to the international cricket with his mysterious cutters and any new weapons he might have devised and that the other will remain fit through the tour. “I am now fit and in good shape; just pray for me so that I can play this series without any trouble,” said Taskin Ahmed prior to the departure for Sydney where the Tigers will attend a preparation camp before leaving for New Zealand on December 19. “The BPL [Bangladesh Premier League] is over. We are now only concentrating on the New Zealand tour. Our first challenge will be to adjust to the conditions. Everyone is eager to perform well in this coming series. I also have a dream as I want to bowl a special spell to win a match for my team. I am practising to add some variations in my bowling,” he added. “I am looking forward to making my comeback in international cricket. If everything goes according to plan and the team management gives me the chance then I will try my best. I know everybody has high hopes and I will try to fulfil them,” said Mustafizur. On the other hand opener Soumya Sarker, who was also among the first batch, will be hoping to get back among the runs to put an end to his prolonged bad patch. “When you go through a bad patch, you find lot of problems. I am trying to rectify those mistakes. Many people are saying many things; many have identified different kinds of problems. To make a comeback I will need to concentrate more on my batting. You cannot overcome all the problems altogether. I am trying my best to get back my rhythm,” said Soumya. Opener Imrul Kayes opined that the New Zealand tour will be a big challenge for them but he said that everyone was determined to do their best during the series. “We are going to play abroad after the World Cup. Bangladesh established themselves as a good side at home but we are yet to prove our worth abroad, so this series creates an opportunity for us to set the record straight,” said Imrul. “From the very beginning I was telling everyone that it will be the biggest challenge for us and it will be an opportunity for our players to show character. I think everyone is planning individually and if we can contribute as a team, we will automatically do well.” দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Bangladesh Cricket: 'Batting will be key'","""Bangladesh cricket has already entered a new era where the Tigers' main aim is to convert their dreams into reality. They are a team whose name is uttered with a lot of respect nowadays when it comes to limited-overs cricket. It was not long ago that they were considered novices in the five-day game despite a few glittering performances, but the entire complexion changed following their recent Test win against England at home. However, a new challenge now stands before the Tigers -- the challenge to make their presence felt on foreign soil. And when Bangladesh Test captain Mushfiqur Rahim exuded confidence of playing good cricket in the upcoming New Zealand tour prior to the team's departure for Sydney, it was not just a case of issuing a catchy soundbite. Mushfiqur knows how big a challenge it will be to push New Zealand in their territory and he was focused on his batsmen as he believes a lot will depend upon how they cope with the demanding conditions. However, he has confidence because of the brilliant way in which the Bangladesh batsmen, including the skipper himself, applied themselves in different yet equally demanding conditions at home during the two-match Test series against England. “I believe the batsmen will have to cope with the conditions and if they can do that, it will be a very good series for us. We have the ability and the confidence. We have good memories of playing good cricket at home against England and I firmly believe that our batsmen are capable of applying themselves in New Zealand's conditions,” said a self-assured Mushfiqur while talking to The Daily Star yesterday. “The performance in the World Cup down under [2015 World Cup in Australia-New Zealand] will also help our confidence. We carry fantastic memories of the World Cup,” he added. Mushfiqur believed that the upcoming series would pose a challenge unlike any other so far while also setting the tone for the Tigers' busy international schedule in the coming months. “This series is a different challenge for us. We have been playing good cricket at home. It is in this series that we will have to prove that we are capable of carrying the momentum,” added the Test skipper, who was accompanying the first batch of cricketers to Australia as part of the Tigers' preparation for the tour. “We have a lot of matches in the coming year and this is a series from where we can take our voyage to a higher destination,” he continued. The injury to two pace bowlers had hampered the think-tank's initial plans but Mushfiqur said that what had happened was out of their hands. “Yes, we suffered a few blows following the injuries to the pacers. I am especially frustrated with [Mohammad] Shahid's injury, but we have no hand in that and I still believe we have a good bowling attack,” opined Mushfiqur. The Tigers will attend a camp in Sydney till December 18 before leaving for New Zealand where they are scheduled to play three ODIs, three T20Is and two Tests against the Black Caps. However, Mushfiqur believed that the camp, no matter how short, would be of great benefit to the team. “It is a very short camp, but we believe it will help us tremendously as it will help us acclimatise with the conditions.” ITINERARY Dec 26: 1st ODI, Christchurch Dec 29: 2nd ODI, Nelson Dec 31: 3rd ODI, Nelson Jan 3: 1st T20, Napier Jan 6: 2nd T20, Mt Maunganui Jan 8: 3rd T20, Mt Maunganui Jan 12-16: 1st Test, Wellington Jan 20-24: 2nd Test, Christchurch দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Frontrunners v underdogs | The Daily Star","""The 2016 edition of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) has been a touch underwhelming as far as the matches, the pitches and the fanfare surrounding the lucrative T20 tournament are concerned. The lukewarm reception is clearly to be seen in the serially low turn-outs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, the venue for today's final between the high-flying Dhaka Dynamites and the fighting underdogs Rajshahi Kings. The pitches in Dhaka will have to take a large share of the blame for the lack of a festive atmosphere in the BPL so far. The average first-innings score in Dhaka has been a less-than-impressive 143.6. Fortunately however, there are other subplots that may pique the watchers' interest. Today's match features the ultimate frontrunners in Dhaka, led by Shakib Al Hasan, against a team that would not have been hot pre-tournament favourites, but one that has drawn strength in unity and inspiration from talismanic skipper Darren Sammy. Their unity was forged under fire as they lost four of their first five matches before finding their feet and going on a winning spree of four matches in the league stage, and are currently riding a three-match streak that has led them to a final. The lynchpin of their batting is Sabbir Rahman, the sole centurion in this year's league, and perhaps the most dangerous player in the final, although there are other very worthy candidates. In the qualifier against Khulna Titans on Wednesday, he displayed a high level of maturity by playing sedately at first and then opening his shoulders when the target was in sight. The message was clear: Sabbir wants to win this and he wants to have a big part in the triumph.  He will be supported by the 17-year-old Afif Hossain, who has so far impressed with both bat and ball and may well be the find of the season, and the likes of Samit Patel, Nurul Hasan and Mominul Haque. The X factor is skipper Sammy, however, as he proved with his barn-storming effort in the Eliminator when he rescued his side against Chittagong Kings with a flurry of late sixes. The in-form bowling unit consists of Kesrick Williams, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, their highest wicket-taker Abul Hasan, Afif and of course, Sammy. All that may still not be good enough to beat Dhaka, the team that from the start of the tournament has seemed like winning the whole thing. At the helm is Shakib's canny leadership and mastery of the format, but backing him up are Kumar Sangakkara, Dwayne Bravo, Andre Russell, Evin Lewis, Nasir Hossain and Mosaddeq Hossain to name but a few. Such is the wealth in depth that Mahela Jayawardene cannot get a place in the 11. They boast the highest wicket-taker in Dwayne Bravo, who has scalped 20, while Lewis has the highest batting strike rate -- 204. Moreover, players like Bravo and Russell have the ability to turn a game with either bat or ball in the space of an over or two -- a quality worth its weight in gold in this format. It is folly to predict the outcome of a T20 match, but Dhaka does have the better team on paper. However, with players like Sabbir and Sammy, Rajshahi does have the ability to provide the inspirational end this tournament needs.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

The men's kabaddi final between India and defending champions Iran descended into chaos and was delayed for over an hour as players and coaches protested over a referee decision with the game level on points and with just over a minute to play. There were sitdown protests from players, heated discussions between coaches and referees and the final was temporarily """"suspended"""". But eventually it restarted and India won 33-29, prompting wild celebrations from the players. India also took gold in the men's cricket as the rain-hit T20 final against Afghanistan was decided by the superpower's superior global ranking. Afghanistan, ranked 10th in the ICC's T20 rankings versus world number one India, were left with silver and powerless to do anything about it after rain halted the match when they were 112 for five after 18.2 overs of the first innings. With India unable to bat a minimum required five overs, play was abandoned soon after 5 p.m. local time (0900 GMT), leaving Ruturaj Gaikwad's team to celebrate victory by default. Deciding results based purely on teams' global rankings is almost unheard of in cricket, let alone for finals in major tournaments. In the men's soccer final reigning champions South Korea, whose team included PSG midfielder Lee Kang-In, beat Japan 2-1 to take the gold and earn all the players an exemption from military service. Earlier on Saturday the Indian women's kabaddi team beat Taiwan 26-25 for gold, without so much drama which enabled India to hit their 100 medal target for the Asian Games. Kabaddi is akin to a cross between tag and rugby, played on a court the length of a badminton court but slightly wider, usually in a seven-against-seven player format. The aim is for a """"raider"""" from the attacking team to run into their opposing team's half, tag as many of the opposition's players as possible and then run back to his or her team's half without being tackled. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called India's medal tally a """"momentous achievement"""", writing on social media platform X: """"The people of India are thrilled that we have reached a remarkable milestone of 100 medals."""" India is fourth in the medals table, comfortably above fifth-placed Uzbekistan and behind China, Japan and South Korea at the games in the eastern Chinese city. The South Asian giant was eighth at the continental sports showpiece five years ago in Jakarta, with 70 medals, their best at the time, including 16 golds. India had targeted 100 medals for the games, which end on Sunday, Bhupender Singh Bajwa, India's chef de mission for the Asian Games, told Reuters. China, which has dominated the medals table in Hangzhou, passed its previous record of 199 golds won when it last hosted the Games in Guangzhou in 2010. That was thanks to a flurry of golds, including in archery, artistic swimming, badminton, canoe slalom, chess, hockey and volleyball. The 200th record-breaking gold was won by 29-year-old Xiangqi (Chinese chess) player Zheng Weitong, after a 2-0 victory over his compatriot Zhao Xinxin. Another came from Zhang Ziyang, 21, who won the men's 10 km marathon swimming race by just four tenths of a second after a nearly two-hour battle with team mate Lan Tianchen, 18, went down to the last stroke. Last week he came sixth in the men's 400 metres freestyle, and won a silver medal in the 4x200 metres freestyle relay. """"I performed average in the swimming pool, so I can say that this medal today is one of the biggest surprises of the Asian Games for me,"""" Zhang said. Japanese """"b-boy"""" Shigeyuki Nakarai, 21, and Chinese """"b-girl"""" Liu Qingyi, 17, ruled the dancefloor at the """"breaking"""" venue to win the first ever golds in breakdancing at the Asian Games on the event's debut ahead of its entry into the Olympic programme for the first time in Paris next summer. """"I feel so happy, I really enjoyed the first battle until the last,"""" said Nakarai after his win. """"The level is so high. Today's tournament was at the highest level in the world, so it wasn't easy for me to win this tournament."""" But many of the dancers, such as Japan's b-girl silver medallist Ami Yuasa, 24, were still getting used to the idea of having sporting status. """"For me it's more like a new challenge, because for me breaking isn't a sport, it's like creating art and expressing myself,"""" said Yuasa. """"It's a little bit difficult for me to see it as a sport."""" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Boxer Selim Hossain stormed into the quarterfinal of the U-57kg category in Asian Games after he knocked down Asror Vokhidov in the second round of the pre-quarterfinals at Hangzhou Gymnasium yesterday. Chinese tennis trailblazer Zhang Zhizhen claimed the nation's first men's singles gold medal at the Asian Games in nearly 30 years on Saturday, riding a wave of crowd support to beat Japan's Yosuke Watanuki 6-4 7-6(7) in Hangzhou. Djokovic and Alcaraz have split their four meetings on tour and the veteran hoped they would continue having matches.

"Modi confirms 2036 Olympics bid | The Daily Star","""Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi confirmed Saturday that his country would bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympics and become just the fourth Asian nation to stage the Games. The world's most populous country is this weekend holding a session of the International Olympic Committee's executive board, which has already resolved to include cricket -- India's most popular sport -- at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles. Modi made the bid announcement while formally opening the meeting after months of hints from members of his government, saying it was the """"dream and aspiration"""" of India's 1.4 billion people. """"India will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to organise the 2036 Olympics,"""" he said. Modi did not mention which city would apply to host the Olympics. But media reports have speculated that Ahmedabad, capital of his home state of Gujarat, was the most likely city to bid. Ahmedabad is home to Narendra Modi Stadium, named for the prime minister and with 132,000 seats, the world's largest sporting venue by capacity. The formal announcement comes just two months after sports minister Anurag Thakur said India was now home to """"top global infrastructure"""" that left it ready to stage the Olympics. """"There should be no question about India's competence,"""" The Hindu newspaper quoted Thakur as saying. India this year held the presidency of the G20 and was roundly praised for its smooth hosting of the world's most powerful leaders. Modi said Saturday that the G20 summit's success was proof that the country was ready to put on """"mega global events"""". But India has struggled to stage large-scale sporting competitions in the past. New Delhi's hosting of the Commonwealth Games in 2010 was marked by construction delays, substandard infrastructure and accusations of financial mismanagement and corruption. India is currently hosting the Cricket World Cup, and was criticised for a delay in announcing the tournament fixture until three months before it began. The schedule was suddenly overhauled a few weeks after it was first published with some of the biggest matches rescheduled. Fans have meanwhile complained about online ticketing crashes, and matches not featuring the hosts have been sparsely attended. Modi's announcement came just moments after India beat Pakistan in the World Cup's most anticipated fixture. Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and Poland are so far the only other countries committed to bidding for 2036. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"India ready to raise curtain on World Cup | ICC World Cup Cricket | The Daily Star","""India target a third World Cup when cricket's global showpiece gets underway on Thursday with the country buoyed by a growing, international self-confidence and with a sport which unites and divides the sub-continent like no other on the verge of joining the Olympic elite. The epic tournament features 10 nations playing 48 matches over 46 days at 10 different venues. However, the build-up has been far from smooth after arch-rivals Pakistan considered a boycott when India refused to travel across the border for the Asia Cup. As a result, the announcement of the schedule for the World Cup was delayed until just three months before the first ball was to be bowled. Fears over security for the India-Pakistan World Cup blockbuster in Ahmedabad then saw the match moved back a day, sparking a domino effect of nine rescheduled fixtures. Pakistan's visit to India is their first since the 2016 Twenty20 World Cup but they were welcomed warmly when they arrived in Hyderabad last week despite only receiving visas just 48 hours before their departure. """"It's been a superb welcome. People coming to the hotel and their hospitality has been fantastic,"""" said leg-spinner Shadab Khan. In an indication of the security tensions, Pakistan's opening warm-up match with New Zealand on Friday was played behind closed doors at an eerily silent 55,000-capacity Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. Torrential rain has also caused an early headache with two warm-up games abandoned without a ball being bowled and a third a reduced overs affair. The opening match on Thursday between champions England and New Zealand as well as the final on November 19 are being staged at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium, named after the prime minister, the world's biggest cricket arena boasting a capacity of over 130,000. India will face Pakistan at the mega-venue on October 14. The city which independence hero Mahatma Gandhi called home for 15 years is tipped as a potential host city should India bid for the 2036 Olympics. Cricket itself -- albeit in its short-format T20 -- is expected to be named an Olympic sport for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles when the International Olympic Committee meets in Mumbai later this month. The gathering of the best players of India's favourite game will be the sporting culmination of a year that saw India overtake China as the world's most populous country, after displacing former coloniser Britain as its fifth-biggest economy in 2021. Modi's global stage? Now Modi is seeking a place on the global stage to match. Courted by the West - despite rights concerns - as a bulwark against Beijing, the prime minister used the G20 summit he hosted this month as a catalyst to position New Delhi as a representative of many others outside traditional power blocs. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party is widely regarded as a certainty to win next year's general election by a crushing majority. India are two-time champions having added the 2011 title on home soil to their 1983 triumph. They boast superstar Virat Kohli who has made more than 13,000 runs in the ODI format. """"The memories of past World Cup victories, especially the iconic 2011 win, are etched in our hearts, and we want to create new memories for our fans,"""" said Kohli. Pakistan, the 1992 champions, have lost seven times out of seven to India at past World Cups. However, skipper Babar Azam will be key to turning around that run as he leads the way in the batting rankings. His average of over 58 betters even that of Kohli. Defending champions England, who triumphed in a nail-biting 2019 final against New Zealand at Lord's, can harness the destructive firepower of Ben Stokes who smashed 84 in that game which went to a Super Over conclusion. The tournament will likely see the farewell ODI performance of Bangladesh skipper Shakib al Hasan, the top-ranked all-rounder in ODI cricket. The 36-year-old has made more than 7,000 runs in the format with 55 half-centuries and 308 wickets. Never far from controversy, Shakib arrives in India after a public spat with axed batsman Tamim Iqbal who he blasted as """"childish"""". Australia are five-time champions and boast veteran David Warner who has amassed over 6,300 ODI runs. South Africa, who have endured a roller-coaster relationship with the World Cup, undone by rain rules in 1992 and 2003, have also been hit by injuries, losing key pacers Anrich Nortje and Sisanda Magala. For Afghanistan, slow bowlers Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, who made his international debut at 16, and Noor Ahmad will be key on welcoming Indian pitches. Sri Lanka, the 1996 winners, will be fired up by the indignity of being bowled out for just 50 and losing the Asia Cup final to India by 10 wickets. Netherlands complete the line-up and are match-tough after negotiating the qualifying round in July where two-time champions West Indies crashed out. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"IAAF to decide on Russia | The Daily Star","""Russia finds out on Friday if the IAAF Council will lift the country's ban from athletics but, even if the vote goes against it, the road to Rio remains open as the IOC will make the final decision on Olympic participation. Russia was suspended from all track and field in November after an independent report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed widespread state-sponsored doping. After a task force reported back that the country appeared to have made little progress on reforms, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Council voted in March to maintain the ban. A further meeting was subsequently arranged for Vienna on Friday with the IAAF Council scheduled to vote on whether to lift it. Any thoughts, though, that Russia may have had about winning over the doubters among the Council members were probably dashed on Wednesday when WADA released another damning report. It said that Russian athletes have continued to fail drug tests and obstruct doping control officers in the months when they are supposed to be showing that there has been a change of culture in their approach to the problem. According to the report, Russian athletes returned 52 adverse findings, including 49 for meldonium. It also said there were 23 missed tests, which the report called """"significant"""", 111 whereabouts failures and 736 tests were declined or cancelled. The IAAF had scheduled the vote for June so that if the ban were to be lifted, Russian athletes would have a reasonable chance to post the Olympic qualifying standards before the July 11 cut-off. It was widely assumed at the time of the March vote, and indeed suggested by IAAF President Sebastian Coe, that if the suspension was to remain in place after Friday then Russia would automatically be unable to take part in track and field at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in August. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has since said that the final decision will be taken by them at a meeting in Lausanne on June 21, amid concerns that clean athletes will suffer for the sins of their team mates and federation. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"FIFA World Cup 2022 - Qatar World Cup Live Updates | The Daily Star","""After hoisting his first World Cup trophy with Argentina in December, Lionel Messi said that tournament would be his last, but now it appears he's open to the possibility of playing in the 2026 event. Lionel Messi was a different kind of mood during the World Cup match against Netherlands and had a war of words with Dutch striker Wout Weghorst during his post-match interview following the match. Argentina’s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was greeted by a crowd estimated at 100,000 in his home town, Mar de Plata. The curtains closed on the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar on Sunday with the Lionel Messi-led Argentina clinching their third title by beating France in the final, but with barely very little time for the fans to let the euphoria sink in, the focus has promptly shifted back to club football. """"Muchachos, we can dream again..."""" the hit song that accompanied Argentina on their conquest of the 2022 World Cup has found deep resonance in a country desperate for a feel-good moment. As the streets of the metropalitans and village Bangladesh are bustling with waving flags, chants, cheers for Lionel Messi and Argentina following their third World Cup victory in a breathtaking final against France on Sunday, Argentina Football Team’s official twitter handle thanked Bangladesh for their wonderful support they showered. Lionel Messi has gone one better again. Having broken the record for the most-liked post on Instagram, the World Cup-winning Argentine's celebratory post has proven so popular that it is now the most-liked social media post of all-time, across any social networking platform.

Lionel Messi’s World Cup fairytale lit up the year in football as heroics and heartbreak at the finals captivated fans and highlighted the growth of the world’s most popular sport despite the criticism of host country Qatar’s human rights record.

Lionel Scaloni hardly ever shows emotion in the dugout. Whether his team scores a crucial goal or a spectacular one, he hardly moves a facial muscle, let alone unleash a joyous celebration like the ones you see from most coaches around the world.

Comilla, who have now won the BPL four times, chased down Sylhet's 175-run total with four deliveries to spare. Charles emerged as the hero for Comilla as the West Indian combined for stands of 70 and 72* with Liton Das and Moeen Ali for the third-wicket and fourth-wicket, respectively. The Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur staged a fascinating encounter overall, worthy of a grand finale. From the onset, the game kept swinging back and forth in the favour of both sides until the fourth last over of the game. Sent in to bat, Sylhet picked 18 runs in the first over but quickly lost in-form opener Towhid Hridoy for naught and their inspirational captain Mashrafe bin Mortaza (1), who again promoted himself up the order. It appeared Sylhet were struggling as scores read 48 for two after seven overs. Opener Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mushfqur Rahim broke the shackles from then on as Sylhet raced to hundred inside twelve overs, with Shanto bringing up his fifty in the process. Shanto got out at 64 eventually, but Mushfiqur (74) ensured Sylhet get to post a challenging total, 175 for seven after 20 overs, despite the veteran Bangladesh batter had kept losing partners at the other end. Chasing 176, Comilla openers Liton Das and Sunil Narine got more than the necessary momentum in the second over as the duo combined to score 20 runs off Tanzim Hasan Sakib. In the following over though, pacer Rubel Hossain gave Sylhet the key breakthrough of Narine, whose 23-ball 57 at the top was pivotal in handing Comilla winning the BPL last year. Skipper Imrul Kayes soon followed suit, removed by George Linde. The South African all-rounder went on to stifle the scoring rate, conceding only 11 runs in his first three overs. Liton then combined with Johnson Charles and the pair brought up Comilla's century after 12 overs, while Liton brought up his fifty off 36 deliveries. Liton's innings, however, perished right after, courtesy of a well-judged catch at the deep from Najmul Hossain Shanto after the stylish Bangladesh batter mistimed a pull shot off Rubel to become his second victim. And in came Moeen Ali and the English star immediately got going, striking consecutive boundaries through the cover off right-arm fast bowler Sakib, whose misery continued on the night. With 60 required off six overs with seven wickets in hand, Comilla had the advantage. In the end, Charles ripped apart the Sylhet bowlers and ended the game in a hurry with a flurry of sixes, while Moeen stayed not out on 25. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

A jersey worn by basketball legend Michael Jordan during Game 1 of the 1998 NBA Finals, his last title victory, is set to be auctioned off in September for an estimated $3-5 million, Sotheby's announced Wednesday. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world. Some of the biggest names and highest earners in the sporting world are basketball players. It is an Olympic sport, represented in two disciplines for both men and women. Bangladesh finished third in the Bangabandhu 6th South Asian Basketball Championship despite suffering a 106-41 points defeat against India at the Shaheed Suhrawardi Indoor Stadium in Mirpur yesterday.

"Basketball crying for a home | The Daily Star","""Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world. Some of the biggest names and highest earners in the sporting world are basketball players. It is an Olympic sport, represented in two disciplines for both men and women. Yet, in Bangladesh the sport is widely neglected, despite having a big fanbase that follows international basketball, especially the NBA, and the fact that the game is played by a measurable size of urban-school-and-college goers as well as by Dhaka-based clubs and teams from the defence forces. Although not affluent or very active, the Bangladesh Basketball Federation (BFF) still runs several domestic events, including the premier league, annually. It also hosts international tournaments every few years and during these tournaments the Dhanmondi Wooden Floor Gymnasium, the home of Bangladesh basketball, takes on a party atmosphere. But all that could turn into a thing of the past as the establishment, situated next to the Abahani club, is being razed to make space for a multi-sport complex, to be named the Sheikh Kamal Sports Complex. Not only as a venue for tournaments, the two-storied building was a year-long home for budding basketball players and basketball enthusiasts from schools and colleges across the capital. Now the place is a bare concrete structure, bereft of the court and equipment, counting the days before it is razed to the ground. All that remains for basketball officials and players are memories forged over almost three decades. Sudesna Biswas, who played for the Bangladesh women's basketball team from 2011-2018, still could not digest the fact that the place was gone forever. """"The memories will never be replaced, but now when I pass by Abahani, I won't be able to look back and point out the gym and tell others what that place is and what it meant to me. So, it feels very hollow. I think it's the same for most people,"""" the 26-year-old told The Daily Star. The irony is that Sheikh Kamal, the eldest son of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after whom the complex is being named, was a leading basketball player in the country in the pre-and-post liberation era. It is not that the sports complex sprung out of nowhere overnight. In fact, it was in the offing for years. Yet the BBF, the National Sports Council -- which gave the BBF the authority to run their activities at the Dhanmondi facility -- and the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the guardian of sports federations of the country, did little to find a new home for the popular sport. """"We have been hearing since 2018, when they began to revamp the field, that Abahni would take back the gym and that it would be under them and not the federation. But we were all hoping for a miracle or at the very least that it would take a lot longer. But in four years, the gym is gone,"""" Sudeshna exclaimed. Ranajit Das, a member of the federation's executive committee, welcomed the initiative to build a complex named after Sheikh Kamal but could not accept that they were being made homeless. """"We are all happy and welcome the building of a sports complex named after Sheikh Kamal. But we have become helpless. We desperately need a new place to conduct our daily activities and organise tournaments. Now I am doing my office work from home,"""" Das told The Daily Star recently. On June 15, the BBF was sent a written notice to move their belongings to the Mirpur indoor stadium, which is supposed to be their new home, and jostle for space and time with a few other federations. Parimal Singha, the recently-appointed secretary of the NSC, told The Daily Star that the BFF would have to come to negotiations with other federations to run their training and official activities at the indoor stadium for the time being. While he did not give any assurances about a permanent home for the sport, BFF officials were hopeful that the NSC and sports ministry would empathise with their plight and look for a permanent solution sooner rather than later. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"NBA stars open gold chase against China | The Daily Star","""It would be easy for the US team of NBA stars to overlook China in Saturday's opening game of the Rio Olympics after routing the Asians twice in pre-Games exhibitions. But the Americans, who have not lost in 10 years, look at such games as a chance to grow and build, first and foremost by not taking anyone for granted in their path to a third consecutive Olympic crown. """"Every team is a threat,"""" US guard Kyrie Irving said. """"We understand it's going to be a fight every single day and I'm looking forward to it."""" The US squad ripped China 106-57 at Los Angeles and 107-57 in Oakland in warm-up games just after the squad was selected. How well they do in their Group A match against China will tell how far they have come. """"These games are very important,"""" Irving said. """"Every single game is a chance for us to get better. We have to find out lineups. We have to find out just what rhythm we want as a team. And, going in, what we want to expect from one another. In order to do that, we have to play high level games and against other great countries."""" And the Chinese squad as NBA experience in Yi Jianlian as well as experience on how to play the Americans already. """"They are physical. They play hard,"""" said US center DeAndre Jordan. """"We know Yi Jianlian, who was playing in the league for a while. And I really like Zhou Qi, the young kid the (Houston) Rockets are drafting. Both of the point guards are really aggressive. They will definitely be a tough opponent. We can't take those guys lightly. We have got to come out and play USA basketball."""" Other Group A men's games include Serbia against Venezuela and Australia, with six NBA players, against host Brazil. The US NBA squad has an 80-1 record under coach Mike Krzyzewski, the 69-year-old veteran from Duke University who finishes as coach after the Rio Games. """"I've learned from my players. I've learned from the international community. I've learned about the beauty of international play,"""" Krzyzewski said. """"Over the last 11 years I've gotten better as a result of being given the honour of coaching, so it has been a beautiful thing for me."""" Between fatigue after a long NBA season and health concerns after talks with family, many top NBA players said no to Rio, including LeBron James, Stephen Curry and James Harden. But former NBA Most Valuable Player Kevin Durant, who left Oklahoma City to join Golden State last month, doesn't see this team as any less formidable because it lacks a few familiar stars. """"It would be challenging even if they were here, but we have some great players here,"""" Durant said. """"Just because they haven't been here before, or might not be MVPs, we've got some damn good players on this team.

"Indo-Pak hysteria grips Ahmedabad | India vs Pakistan World Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","""Cricket fever has gripped Ahmedabad ahead of Saturday's World Cup group stage clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan and a visit to the hospitals near the venue of the match in the western Indian city clearly shows the degree of excitement. Quite a few of the hospitals have seen a sudden influx of patients booked in for check-ups involving a night's stay to coincide with the most anticipated match of the World Cup. Several doctors told local media the rush for check-up 'packages' was an ingenious way to find affordable accommodation as hotel costs have soared up to 20 fold ahead of the match. """"We have come across some cases of people coming to watch the India-Pakistan match also taking an appointment for health check-ups and staying in hospitals,"""" Tushar Patel, President of the Ahmedabad Medical Association, told Reuters. The Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association has discouraged its members from accommodating such fans. """"We have asked our members not to entertain such requests. Hospitals are not meant for non-patients,"""" its president Bharat Gadhavi told Reuters. THREE WARS The Asian neighbours have fought three wars since becoming separate countries in 1947 and the relationship further soured after gunmen killed 166 people in Mumbai in 2008, which India blamed on a Pakistani militant group. While bilateral cricket became a casualty of geopolitical realities, it also whetted the appetite for a clash between neighbours who play each other only in multi-team events. India and Pakistan head into the showdown having both won their opening two matches at the tournament. The first batch of tickets for Saturday's game were sold out within an hour of going on sale in August, prompting the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to release another 14,000 earlier this month. Ahmedabad resident Hemish Patel and his friends, after several days of failed attempts, grabbed four tickets, each costing 6,000 Indian rupees ($72.15). """"We logged into the site with multiple devices,"""" he said. """"We constantly kept on refreshing the site and were able to book within 10 minutes after the sale of tickets began."""" Patel was one of the lucky few. Tickets are fetching up to 25 times face value on resale and city police arrested four youths on Tuesday for selling fakes. Airfare has surged up to four times and Indian railways will run a pair of super fast trains linking Mumbai and Ahmedabad. PERFECT VENUE The 134,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium, which hosted former US President Donald Trump in 2020 and Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese earlier this year, looks a perfect arena for cricket's fiercest rivalry. The city has been declared a 'no-drone zone' on Saturday, and 11,000 security personnel will be deployed for the high-profile match, Ahmedabad police commissioner GS Malik said. On their first tour of India since the 2016 T20 World Cup, Pakistan were accorded a warm welcome in Hyderabad, where they played their first two matches. India have a perfect 7-0 record against Pakistan at ODI World Cups and while the rivalry assumes the Orwellian concept of serious sport -- """"war minus the shooting"""" -- players from both sides share good relations. During the Sri Lanka leg of the Asia Cup last month, Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Afridi gave Jasprit Bumrah a gift for the Indian's newborn baby and the video went viral. It will be a special occasion for Indian Liyakat Khan, whose daughter Samiya is married to Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali.

Rohit said the team has momentum after they won the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka and then beat Australia in a three-match series. """"Rhythm is very important. If you look at it in other terms, it is called momentum,"""" Rohit told reporters on the eve of the hotly-anticipated match. """"We have played seven or eight matches in India and before that in Sri Lanka and here too we played two matches of the World Cup."""" He added: """"The bowlers have shown very good performances.

"Mohammad Rafique on top in Chennai! | Bangladesh vs New Zealand | The Daily Star","""The images of Shakib Al Hasan and Kane Williamson on a digital advertising board were greeting all arrivals at the airport in Chennai. The message was clear: the Bangladesh-New Zealand World Cup match will take place at the city's MA Chidambaram Stadium the next day. The distance between Dharamshala and Chennai is over 2500 kilometres, and that difference is reflected in the variances of the two region's culture, food habit and language. From the mountains in Northern India, the team is now Southern India, at the edge of the Bay of Bengal. Yes, our very own Bay of Bengal. The city of Chennai, which at one time was known as Madras, is right beside the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh's ties with this city have gotten stronger over the past few decades as many Bengalis frequent this part of India for medical purposes. There were signs of that bond everywhere. There were restaurants offering Bengali food, even some signboards were written in Bangla. Even Bengali language channels were being telecast on the television. All were clear signs that Bengalis have a sizable presence in Chennai. Like the familiar waves of the Bay of Bengal at the edge of the city of Chennai, the 22 yards inside the Chidambaram Stadium could give the Bangladesh team a sense of familiarity. The pitches here assist the spinners. According to many, Chennai is the Mirpur of India. Although the conditions are in Bangladesh's favour, no one of the current Bangladesh team has ever played at the venue. Bangladesh have played only one match at the ground in 1998 against Kenya in the Coca-Cola Cup, which they lost by 28 runs. Surprisingly, however, one Bangladeshi occupies the top-spot in the highest wicket-takers' list in ODIs at the ground. His name – Mohammad Rafique. But how could Rafique be the highest wicket-taker if Bangladesh have played just one ODI at the venue? It's because although Bangladesh have played just one ODI here, Rafique has played three. One for the Tigers and the other two for the Asian XI against the African XI. In 2007, the Afro-Asia Cup series was played in India. Two Bangladeshi cricketers - Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Rafique - played in that series for the Asian XI under the captaincy of Mahela Jayawardene. In the second match, Rafique took two wickets for 62 runs and then in the third ODI, the left-arm spinner finished with 4-65. In the 1998 game against Kenya, Rafique took two wickets for 45 runs. Rafique, in total, has eight wickets at the venue, which puts him at the top of the ODI wicket-takers' list. India's Ajit Agarkar, Harbhajan Singh and Kuldeep Yadav and South Africa's Morne Morkel are jointly occupying the second spot with seven wickets each. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Shakib leads batting disappointment | New Zealand Beat Bangladesh By 8 wickets | The Daily Star","""Soft dismissals, unforced errors have led to the demise of the Bangladesh top-order in recent times, and it was no exception against New Zealand in their third ICC World Cup fixture in Chennai yesterday. It was not uncommon to see the Bangladesh top four batter sent packing inside 13 overs, given it marked the seventh instance in the last 10 ODIs where Bangladesh went on to lose four wickets before reaching three figures. But what followed, after skipper Shakib Al Hasan steadied the ship Mushfiqur Rahim, was the most frustrating from the Bangladesh perspective. Veterans with five World Cup experience, Shakib and Mushfiqur did make their experience count somewhat, but the job was far from done for the two Bangladesh stalwarts when the former faltered. At 145 for four after 29 overs, knowing that they have a long tail, the situation required Shakib and Mushfiqur to play sensibly for another five to six overs to lay the platform of a near 270. A while earlier, Shakib had suffered a cramp and he proceeded without wearing a cap or a helmet in a never-before-seen act from the ace all-rounder. While it was not surprising to see the Bangladesh skipper opting to aim for the boundaries to compensate for his compromised running ability, his overtly aggressive approach did not reflect his wealth of experience. Following drinks break, spinner Rachin Ravindra was on the receiving end of a four and a six from Shakib. The next over, a top-edge off a Lockie Ferguson delivery resulted in a six over backward square leg as Shakib reached forty but he paid the price next ball, having played one shot too many. Eventually, Mushfiqur Rahim's 66 and a rearguard action from seasoned campaigner Mahmudullah Riyad, who scored an unbeaten 49-ball 41 on his first appearance in the ongoing event, gave their bowlers something to defend. Going back to the innings' start, Liton Das chose to mark his birthday with a golden duck, caught at deep fine leg, and that too in the first delivery of the innings bowled by Trent Boult. Bangladesh, thus, were on the back foot from the onset on what turned out to be a batting-friendly surface. And despite all the noise that the surface at the MA Chidambaram stadium was primed to be a spinner's paradise, New Zealand pacers eventually shared seven of nine scalps. Bangladesh batters can only blame themselves at the end of day. Young Tanzid Hasan Tamim timed a flick and found the fielder at the in-field after a promising 16 off 17 balls, while in-form Mehedi Hasa Miraz, in at number three, departed in similar fashion to Liton after a well-compiled 30. The worst fear was coming true for Bangladesh, it seemed, once Najmul Hossain Shanto – who averaged 80-plus in last five ODIs – was the next to get out following another soft dismissal against the run of play. This time, off-spinner Glenn Phillips found his victim without much effort. Apart from Mushfiqur, who fell to Matt Henry's brilliantly executed slower delivery that bounced low, none of the top six Bangladesh batters looked like they were up for an occasion of World Cup's magnitude. The execution was vividly lacking on the day, but the team management's decision to keep shuffling the top-order is also bound to come under heavy scrutiny. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Shakib Al Hasan Injured: Shakib injury scare in heavy defeat | The Daily Star","""Bangladesh were potentially handed a double blow on Friday as the Tigers saw skipper Shakib Al Hasan walk off the field with an injury in their heavy eight-wicket defeat against New Zealand at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai yesterday. Shakib strained his left quad while batting and could not field till the end of the game. He was taken for a scan. """"Shakib has gone for a scan. So, we will know more [about it] after that,"""" said Bangladesh batter Najmul Hossain Shanto on Shakib's injury during the post-match presentation ceremony. Meanwhile, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson marked his return to the World Cup with an undefeated 78 but the Kiwi captain also saw his involvement in the game cut short due to an injury. Chasing 246 to win, Williamson, playing his first ODI since January after being sidelined due to a knee injury, had reached his 43rd fifty in the format off 81 balls. He moved on to 78 with eight fours and a six when he had to call it quits after a throw from the deep rapped him painfully on the glove. But New Zealand comfortably wrapped up their third win with 43 balls to spare. Williamson had put on a second-wicket stand of 80 with opener Devon Conway (45) and then 108 with Daryl Mitchell who scored an unbeaten 89. Earlier, Mushfiqur Rahim top-scored for the Tigers with a 75-ball 66 to lead Bangladesh to 245-9 while veteran Black Caps fast bowler Trent Boult claimed a 200th one-day international wicket. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

The 33-year-old had been sidelined since suffering a serious knee injury at the IPL and missed New Zealand's two opening victories at the World Cup. Chasing 246 to win, Williamson took a painful blow to his hand when the ball was thrown in from the field as he attempted a run. Daryl Mitchell top-scored for the Kiwis with an unbeaten 89 while Mushfiqur Rahim made 66 for Bangladesh who have lost two of their three games. Before Williamson and Mitchell fifties propelled the Kiwis to victory with ease, Mushfiqur top-scored and Mahmudullah Riyad hit an unbeaten 41 to help Bangladesh finish with 245 for nine in a game that saw veteran Black Caps fast bowler Trent Boult claim his 200th one-day international wicket. Mushfiqur laced his innings with six fours and two sixes, taking his number of fifties in the format to 48 having also hit a half-century against England in the tournament three days ago. The 36-year-old, playing in his 259th ODI, shared a crucial 96-run fourth wicket partnership with skipper Shakib Al Hasan (40) to help their team recover from 56-4. Mushfiqur was eventually clean-bowled by Matt Henry as he attempted to pick up the scoring rate after Shakib had perished, caught by wicketkeeper Tom Latham off Lockie Ferguson after top-edging an attempted pull shot. Shakib ended his innings suffering from cramps in the sweltering heat and batting without a helmet or cap against the spinners. Mushfiqur's brother-in-law Mahmudullah, batting at number eight, played a valuable knock. Boult, meanwhile, became the sixth New Zealand player to take 200 ODI wickets. The 34-year-old reached the personal landmark when he dismissed Towhid Hridoy, caught at extra cover by Mitchell Santner for 13, in the 38th over. Playing in his 107th ODI, Boult also dismissed opener Liton Das off the first ball of the match. Liton was celebrating his 29th birthday but any hopes of a big score to mark the occasion were shattered when he shuffled down the wicket to confront Boult only to sky the ball to a grateful Henry who pocketed the chance at fine leg. Captain Williamson returned to action after missing New Zealand's first two wins over defending champions England and the Netherlands as he recovered from a knee injury. Bangladesh opened their World Cup campaign with victory over Afghanistan before losing to England. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"The wait for Rajnikanth’s phone call amid cricket fever | The Daily Star","""For Bangladeshis, one of the biggest challenges while touring Chennai is the language barrier. While in India, Bangladeshis usually interact with the locals in Hindi - a foreign language most people in the country have a decent understanding of thanks to Bollywood movies. But in Chennai, the knowledge of Hindi is of little to no use. Hardly anyone speaks the language in the region. The locals speak in Tamil, the official language of the Tamil Nadu state. The only other language one can hear while roaming around the city is English. So, the Bangladeshi tourists have to resort to a mix of English words and animated hand gestures to communicate with the locals, often unsuccessfully. This language barrier makes traveling around the city a hassle. However, this problem dissipates by the mention of one person. As soon as his name is uttered, the locals know exactly where a non-Tamil speaking tourist wants to go. That person, of course, is the Indian movie superstar Rajnikanth. The 72-year-old actor is one of the biggest icons of the silver screen South India has ever produced and is revered as a deity in Chennai. His residence in Chennai is like a tourist attraction as his fans from across the globe come to this part of the world to go to his home, hoping to catch a glimpse of the iconic actor. After landing in Chennai yesterday to cover Bangladesh's third match in the ICC ODI World Cup against New Zealand, this correspondent had some time to spare in the afternoon in between filing reports and decided to use this window to visit Rajnikanth's residence. All this correspondent had to do was utter the name, 'Rajnikanth' and the autorickshaw driver immediately knew where I wanted to go. He nodded his head with a smile on his face and without any further delay, I started my journey to the superstar's home. It didn't take long to reach Poes Garden, the posh residential area where Rajnikanth lives. The autorickshaw was stopped by security at a dead end. The correspondent completed the rest of the journey on foot and before long, I was standing in front of a two-storied duplex villa with the name plate 'Rajnikanth' outside the main gate. This correspondent wasn't alone as many other Rajni fans were standing in front of 18, Raghava Veera Avenue, Poes Garden, clicking photos. The superstar, however, was not at home as he was out of town, shooting his upcoming movie. I thought I would have to stay content with a few pictures with the superstar's home in the backdrop. But after the polite guards got to know that I had come all the way from Bangladesh, they gave me a photo of Rajnikanth along with his autograph written 'God bless.' The guards also asked me to write down my name and phone number in the visitor's diary. They said that Rajnikanth checks the diary often and even calls the visitors if he feels like it. This was just one of many kind acts Rajnikanth is renowned for. The South Indian movie star is known for providing food for the hungry, funding education of poor children and building old age homes all across the country. Even though I couldn't see him in person, it was a great experience. And since that visit, every time my phone rings and I see an unknown number come up on screen, I pick it up in a hurry, hoping that the man on the other side is the superstar himself.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Rony hits ton on NCL opening day | The Daily Star","""Dhaka division opener Rony Talukdar struck the first century of the 25th edition of the National Cricket League (NCL), hitting a 112-ball 102 against Rangpur on the opening day of their Tier 1 encounter at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka today. Rony nearly carried his bat through the innings before departing as the final batter, as Rangpur bundled out Dhaka for just 166. Pacer Nobin Islam was the pick of the Rangpur bowlers, finishing with five for 28. Rony started his morning with a punch through the covers for four and kept dealing in boundaries, hitting 19 fours against the seaming and swinging duke ball while wickets kept falling at regular succession at the other end. Only two other Dhaka batters got into double figures as they got bundled out for a paltry total. In reply, the defending champions Rangpur ended the day at 133 for three with Mim Mosaddek unbeaten on 55. At the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chattogram, Pinak Ghosh and Mominul put on a second wicket partnership of 191 for Chattogram division against Barishal in their Tier 2 match, however, both batters missed out on tons.

"Dhaka Division, Khulna seal big wins | The Daily Star","""Dhaka Division kept their hopes alive in the title race after they managed to seal a thumping 333-run win over table-toppers Sylhet on the third day of their National Cricket League Tier 1 encounter at the Sylhet International Stadium on Wednesday. With two wins from five games, Dhaka are now in the second position with 19 points. Despite the defeat, Sylhet stayed on top of the table with 21 points heading towards the sixth and final round of the tournament. Chasing a mammoth 495-run target, Sylhet crumbled and were bundled out for 161 runs. Pacers Sumon Khan and Salauddin Sakil were instrumental for Dhaka, bagging three wickets each. Meanwhile, Towfiq Khan's 58 was the highest score by a Sylhet batter. In a Tier 2 game, Khulna clinched their first win of the tournament by registering a comprehensive 10-wicket victory over Barishal at the Shaheed Kamruzzaman Stadium in Rajshahi. Barishal, who were asked to follow on, resumed the third day at 46 for three. Moin Khan scored a century to help Barishal to 256 all-out and post a small target of 87 runs. Pacer Al Amin Hossain picked up six wickets while Mrittunjoy Chowdhury, Nahidul Islam, and Jawad Royen took two wickets each for Khulna.

But following their departure, Chattogram lost a few quick wickets before stumps. Earlier, thanks to an unbeaten 131 from Naeem Islam, Rangpur took a first-innings lead of 263 runs and declared their innings on 363 for 7. In a Tier 2 game, Rajshahi's Mushfiqur Rahim missed out on a hundred for just three runs but his knock helped his team take a 138-run lead in their second innings against Dhaka Metropolis in Cox's Bazar. Mushfiqur, who smashed a hundred in the opening round of the tournament, was dismissed on 97 off 155 deliveries. Dhaka Metro took a first-innings lead of 131 runs and were bundled out for 373.

"Flashback 2018 Asia Cup: Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka | The Daily Star","""The Asia Cup will back to its old 50-over format when the 16th edition of the regional cricket extravaganza kicks off in Pakistan and Sri Lanka from August 30, after its recent edition featured the shortest format last year. As the Tigers are gearing up for the six-team tournament under the leadership of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, The Daily Star Sports look back to the Tigers' performances in 2018 Asia Cup in UAE, played in their preferred 50-over format. A FLYING START Bangladesh won the opening match against Sri Lanka by a crushing 137-run margin at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, courtesy of Mushfiqur Rahim's 150-ball 144. The right-hander lifted Bangladesh to 261 after they were reduced to one run for two wickets by the end of the first over by danger man Lasith Malinga. But the match had something different in store. One delivery in particular had set in motion a chain of events that Bangladesh fans relive to this day. In the 47th over, opener Tamim Iqbal strode out at number 11, when all the players had thought Mustafizur Rahman's run out was the end of the innings. He played out one delivery with a broken left wrist tucked behind his hip – a scene that spoke volumes. That bit of bravery for the team's cause in the 46.5th over when Bangladesh were just 229 for nine on a good batting wicket galvanised the Tigers and judging by Sri Lanka's sorry reply that saw them get bundled out for 124, thoroughly demoralised the opposition. Tamim played out the last delivery of the over from Suranga Lakmal, who had sent him to the hospital with a bouncer that pinged his left wrist in only the second over of the innings. The left-handed batter did not need to play another ball in the next three overs as Mushfiqur plundered 32 runs off the next 15 balls, farming the strike and unfurling shots of pure genius that resulted in three fours and three sixes to take his tally to 11 boundaries and four maximums respectively. He fell with three balls still left, but by then the tide had irrevocably turned. Then came the magnificent bowling effort from the Tigers to skittle Sri Lanka for 124 runs. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

""""I was very happy at the way I batted, I felt confident."""" The left-handed opener said that a BCB higher-up had asked him not to play the opening match of the World Cup against Afghanistan.

Bangladesh were bundled out for just 193 runs with 68 balls to spare, with the majority of the batters throwing their wickets away and showing a lack of game awareness after electing to bat on a batting-friendly Gaddafi wicket. """"We played some ordinary shorts as we lost early wickets in the first 10 overs but that happens,"""" Shakib said at the post-match presentation. """"But we had a very good partnership and I think we should have kept on going probably for another seven-eight overs, we could have built a platform from where we could launch. But that never happened; as soon as I got out, there was no more partnership,"""" Shakib said in his candid admission. """"All in all, I think it was a very poor batting display on a surface like this and I think we have to take it on our chin and move on to the next one because in a couple of days' time, we have another important game,"""" the all-rounder added. Bangladesh lost wickets up front, with Mehedi Hasan Miraz, the centurion from the previous game against Afghanistan, departing for a golden duck with a soft dismissal. Liton Das, playing in his first game of the tournament, looked promising until he poked at an away delivery from Shaheen Shah Afridi for 16 while Naim Sheikh and Towhid Hridoy fell victim to the extra pace of Haris Rauf. The Tigers were struggling at that stage with 47 for four inside the Powerplay. Bangladesh came back well with a hundred-run fifth-wicket stand between Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim and it seemed that the Tigers would go on to post a formidable total.

"Tigers win nail-biter against India | Bangladesh beat India by 6 runs in Asia Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","""Bangladesh prevailed in a game of nerves, exiting the Asia Cup with a narrow six-run win in their final Super Four game over tournament finalists India at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo yesterday. After Shubman Gill's 121 off 133, a late 34-ball 42-run cameo from Axar Patel threatened to take the game away but Bangladesh bowlers managed to stay composed, bundling out India for 259 in 49.5 overs while defending a 266-run target. Bowling a crucial penultimate over, Mustafizur Rahman, one of the five changes made in the Bangladesh eleven for the game, turned up with the goods for the Tigers. Needing 17 off the last two overs and Patel well-set at one end, India looked to be in the driver's seat. However, with his trademark cutter, Mustafizur got rid of Shardul Thakur in the very first delivery of the 49th over. The left-arm pacer was hit for a boundary by Patel but went on to dismiss the batter in the very next delivery when he mistimed another one of Mustafizur's cutters and was caught by a running fielder at long-off. The finishing touches were provided by debutant Tanzid Hasan Sakib, who also initiated proceedings with two crucial breakthroughs to jolt India early in their chase. Sakib bowled three dots on the trot in the final over, ratcheting up the pressure on the tailenders who then needed 12 from three. Shami managed to hit Sakib for a boundary the following delivery but the young pacer had the last laugh as Shami, forced to run a double to keep the match alive, was made run out in the penultimate delivery as Bangladesh recorded their first-ever victory in Colombo. Before all the drama unfolded in the last few overs, off-spinner Mahedi Hasan impacted with the crucial wicket of Gill in the 44th over. It was a promising display of cricket by the Tigers, who only had an 89-run win over Afghanistan in the group stage to show for before yesterday's dead rubber. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan stepped up and led from the front as he stitched together a 101-run fifth-wicket stand with Towhid Hridoy to provide stability in the middle after a rocky beginning with the bat. Shakib, who has not been able to play to his full potential throughout the Asia Cup – played as a prelude to the ODI World Cup in India next month – looked to have found his rhythm with the willow. With six fours and three maximums, Shakib scored 80 off 85 deliveries before falling short of his 10th ODI hundred when he played a Shardul delivery onto his stumps in the 34th over. With Shakib back in the hut, it seemed the Tigers' innings would fizzle out soon, especially after in-form Hridoy holed one out to square leg after a 54-run knock to leave Bangladesh at 193 for seven. However, Nasum Ahmed came as a surprise package down the order, smashing his career-best 44 off 45, laced with six boundaries and one maximum. His knock was well complemented by unbeaten knocks of 29 and 14 from Mahedi Hasan and debutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib as Bangladesh reached a competitive total of 265 for eight. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Critical decisions due before final call | The Daily Star","""As the fitness camp for the 32-member squad gets underway at the Sher-e-Bangla National stadium in Mirpur today, Bangladesh selectors will also enter the critical step to finalise squad for the upcoming Asia Cup and World Cup this year. It will be interesting to see whether the criteria of the team-selection would eventually boil down to personal preferences, team combination or the need of experience. The selectors are thus in for an anxious ride in prioritising their agendas. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) seems to have a clear vision when it comes to having a plan with or without Bangladesh ODI captain Tamim Iqbal for the coming days. However, the team management is bound to struggle in finding a replacement for the experienced left-hander. Apart from Tamim, however, few names are already creating a lot of interest: the possibility of the return of experienced Mahmudullah Riyad or Soumya Sarkar -- which according to many is because of Tigers head coach Chandika Hathurusingha possessing a soft spot for the elegant stroke-maker. Soumya was a major find of Hathurusingha during his first stint, where the left-hander made his mark with some blistering batting. However, things have changed a lot over the years. Soumya, who last played an ODI back in 2021, was dropped due to his prolonged poor run of form with the bat. The team management had also tried to use Soumya as a seaming all-rounder but the 30-year-old could not turn the tide. Soumya's latest inclusion in the ACC Emerging Asia Cup also raised plenty of eye brows as he failed to make impact while batting at number six position. It remains to be seen whether team management would go for a short-term solution for the mega event by bestowing the role of a finisher to Soumya. It was learned that some part of the team management and board officials are not fully convinced over the potential inclusion of Soumya in the national team, considering his abysmal form for around the past year. The talks over the inclusion of Riyad for the mega events based on his wealth of experience, on the other hand, has been widely discussed. At the same time, reservations exist within the team management over his fitness and form. The 37-year-old, who was dropped since the England series in March this year, will feature in the preliminary camp from today. The topic of Riyad will be in midst before the selectors announce a 22–23-member squad later next week. According to sources, it is still a 50-50 chance for Riyad to make the cut in the Tigers final squad for the upcoming events. Tamim Iqbal, meanwhile, is rested for a week after the cricketer was administered a few injections as he currently remains under observation in the UK. The 34-year-old is then expected to start his rehabilitation. According to sources, Tamim may take another dose of injection as part of his treatment process. Such injections generally help players to manage pain within three months but pain may occur before the time frame. In that case, Tamim's call will remain as the final. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

He made history when he became the first Black South African to score a Test hundred, against England in 2016. But he needed patience over the next seven years, two months and 88 innings as he waited for his second Test ton. He needed patience with his ODI career as well. It started in 2016 with a century against Ireland but his second ODI came a year later in October 2017, when he scored 48. He had to wait even longer, almost two and a half years, to play his third in February 2020 - he celebrated his recall with 98 against England. Bavuma then took over as ODI captain in March 2021. At five foot three, he lacks the brute power of many ODI thrashers - but he has timing and technique.

"'Injury concerns' prompted Tamim's exclusion | The Daily Star","""Finally, when the dust settled yesterday night after almost 24 hours of speculation and rumorus, it was revealed that the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) did not include seasoned campaigner Tamim Iqbal among the 15 selected to represent the country in the 13th edition of the World Cup, to be played in India from October 5 to November 19. Although it came as a surprise to the entire nation and the fans, the national selectors had a straightforward reason behind Tamim's exclusion. """"There are some injuries which you can't take a risk with. This is very important. If we include someone and that player suffers from injury after going to the World Cup, then that would see the team management in a fix. So, that's a risk. So, we took this decision after considering all these,"""" chief selector Minhajul Abedin Nannu, addressing the media in Mirpur last night, said while pointing out Tamim's recurring back injury as the main reason behind dropping the opener from the World Cup squad. This was set to be Tamim's fifth ODI World Cup, having represented the country in every edition of the mega event since mesmerising everyone in his first in the West Indies in 2007. The exclusion of the country's best opener from one of the biggest cricketing events raised a lot of questions, especially since there were a lot of rumours circulating in mainstream as well as social media. One such rumour was that skipper Shakib Al Hasan, who will lead the Tigers in the World Cup for the second time after having done so in 2011, was reluctant to captain the side if Tamim was included. """"We were never relayed any such information. We heard many things in the media but nothing of that sort was relayed to us,"""" added Minhajul. Another rumour suggested that Tamim had informed the board that he would only be able to play five of the compulsory nine games the Tigers are set to play in the mega event in India. Answering this query, Minhajul said: """"No. Let me clear this to everyone, we never received any information that Tamim would only play five games or anything like that."""" The chief selector repeated a number of times that a proper procedure was followed while deciding the squad. """"The squad is prepared after discussing with the medical department, team management, players, the skipper, and the head coach as well. We followed the same procedure as we normally do in the case of any other player. """"You also have to keep in mind that Tamim could not play the final game against New Zealand. He played the first game, and the second, and then we had to rest him in the final ODI. He felt a bit of pain [in his back] after he batted and fielded in the second game,"""" Minhajul asserted. It is customary for the selectors to announce the squad and take questions regarding before any major event, but with what had happened since Monday night, probably the selectors were not the right people to face the media yesterday. Even though the events that transpired in the country's cricketing fraternity yesterday were consistent with how usually things happen almost before every major event, Tamim's exclusion, despite all the reasoning provided by the BCB, keeps a scope for many more questions. Maybe some of those questions of the curious cricket fans and media personnel will be answered when Tamim speaks up, as the 34-year-old left-handed batter confirmed to The Daily Star yesterday that he would provide his own statement regarding the incident. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"The cup of our lives | ICC ODI World Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","""As the 13th edition of the ICC ODI World Cup kicks off in Ahmedabad today, it is time we took a dive into what makes cricket so special to so many people around the world. The world of cricket has been blessed with many inspiring stories over centuries: stories of human excellence, of victory against adversity, of bringing social and political change using the power of the game, and of uniting people regardless of their colour, creed, religion and ethnicity. The meteoric rise of Afghanistan as a cricketing nation is probably one of the most heartwarming stories, not only in cricket, but in global sport in the new millennium. A battleground of foreign dynasties, colonialists and imperialists through centuries, the rugged terrains of Afghanistan have produced one of the most enterprising teams in cricket's history, bringing enormous joy to the lives of a people in perpetual strife. And it has all happened in the matter of two mere decades, despite the heavy odds faced by its cricketers and cricket organisers. And when one considers the fact that this cricketing revolution was set in motion by one of the most tragic episodes of the country's history, the enormity of Afghanistan's cricketing fairytale becomes all the more poignant. Barring football, no other sport has possibly touched so many lives like cricket, shaping so many dreams and uniting so many people. It is a sport that brings about that rare evening of fun and frolly for the South Asian diaspora in foreign lands – an occasion to reminisce about the good old days back home. It is a sport that offers hope to a nation when its political leaders set aside their differences to sing praise of its cricketing icons. It is a sport that set the fire burning through the veins of every neutral fan when a bunch of rugged men from the Caribbeans made their colonial masters grovel in their own game. Once a symbol of British colonialism and a treasure of the social elite, cricket has long since cast off its colonial cloak and taken its place in the hearts and minds of common people. And that appeal has been continuously reinforced and emboldened by the ODI World Cup. The quadrennial event sits like a crown jewel in the heart of the sport's ever-evolving and expanding galaxy. Ever since it came into being in 1975, ICC's showpiece 50-over event has only gained in popularity and global acceptance, withstanding the pristine charm of Test cricket and the marauding rise of Twenty20. Of course there are flaws in how the game in general is run by its global body and how the format of the World Cup is altered in almost every other edition, but the appeal of the flagship event has hardly ever shown signs of easing up. From the days of all whites in the '70s and '80s through the colourful transition in the '90s and into the rollicking '20s of the new millennium, the ICC ODI World Cup has set new standards with every edition and made new heroes to be worshipped across the cricketing world. That is why the best always want to be there in the World Cup; that is why Ben Stokes unretired just a few days ahead of the 13th edition to have a go at one more global glory; that is why Kane Williamson has been carefully recuperated so that he can lead the golden generation of his nation to one last shot at the global crown; that is why an entire nation has been left looking for answers over the exclusion of one of its finest cricketers. Today in Ahmedabad, at the biggest cricket stadium in the world, the World Cup juggernaut will set off for a long and winding journey across India, and will return to the same venue for one final time 45 days later to find an eventual winner, leaving in its wake many memories, records and stories to be recounted for the next four years and beyond. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Shaken but far from shattered | The Daily Star","""Every other day in the country, a horrific road accident ruins a family or any individual's dream, and such an unfortunate incident in 2015 left Bangladesh cricketer Nihaduzzaman to the point of no return. Although the then 16-year-old was lucky enough to survive, his career was on the brink of being nipped in the bud. """"The first accident happened in 2015. I felt the urge to return to the field once the doctor pulled the stitches off my head,"""" Nihaduzzaman told The Daily Star. Nihaduzzaman was a member of Bangladesh's ICC U-19 World Cup team in 2014. While the lanky left-arm spinner is still having to prove himself on the domestic circuit, 10 out of 14 players from that squad have already made their international debut for Bangladesh, and the likes of Liton Das, Mustafizur Rahman, and Mehedi Hasan Miraz are an integral part of the Tigers' setup at present. """"Before the accident, I was called up for the High Performance (HP) camp and was optimistic about the future."""" Nihaduzzaman's recovery was always going to be a long, agonising one but shortly after returning to the pitch in 2017, he broke his hand, and this time he had feared the worst. """"It proved difficult for me to lift a two-kilo object even three months after the [second] accident. I could not even rotate my wrist, let alone bowl. I felt as if I would never be able to bowl again. The fracture eventually healed but my hand lacked power,"""" he revisited. Nihaduzzaman's sheer will, however, enabled him to ride past the pessimism surrounding the possibility of ever returning to his former self as playing opportunities got scarcer. This time in the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), the cricketer from Rajshahi garnered serious attention. """"I was able to return to the field bit by bit and resumed bowling. But the condition of my hand forced me to change my [bowling] action. It was a struggle that I will not be able to express in words now,"""" the 24-year-old recollected. Nihaduzzaman with his revamped action had scalped 12 wickets in nine BPL matches this season, boasting an impressive economy of 7.22 for Chattogram Challengers. """"Sohel [Islam, local spin bowling coach] Sir got my back, and I trusted him and followed his instructions. Changing my bowling action and getting comfortable with it was not easy at all. I was torn between a new bowling action and the older one. If you look at my bowling fingers, you will find how distorted they are because of the toil they took while adjusting to the new action,"""" said Nihaduzzaman, who is an avid fan of Shakib Al Hasan. """"Although I'm primarily a left-arm spinner, I enjoy batting a lot. So, I aspire to be known as a bowling all-rounder in the coming days. My idol is [Former New Zealand captain] Daniel Vettori. I also take notes from Shakib Bhai's bowling. I find his mentality charming as he is much more forward-thinking compared to the rest of us."""" Nihaduzzaman mentioned that he is working on his batting skills of late. He aspires to be an all-format world-class cricketer and serve the national team as a utility player if given the opportunity. """"I believe I had a reasonably successful BPL campaign this time with Chattogram, but the goal was to learn as much as possible for the future.

"Abahani set up first final against Mohammedan in 12 years | The Daily Star","""Record 12-time champions Abahani will meet archrivals Mohammedan in the Federation Cup final after 14 years following their 3-0 win over Sheikh Russel KC at the Shaheed Dhirendra Nath Dutta Stadium in Cumilla on Tuesday. Mohammedan had earlier beaten favourites Bashundhara Kings 2-1 in the first semifinal last week. The final will be held in Cumilla on May 30. Sheikh Russel and Bashundhara Kings will square off for the third position match on May 23 in Gopalganj. The May 30 final will be the first cup final between the country's two most popular football clubs in 12 years. The last time these two teams met in a final was in the 2011 Super Cup, where Abahani came out victorious. However, the last time these two teams met in a Federation Cup final was in 2009 where Mohammedan had the last laugh. Abahani had since then played in five Federation Cup finals, winning all of those including the last one in 2021-22. In today's game, Daniel Colindres gave Abahani a 38th minute lead with a powerful diagonal shot following a long-ball from Rezaul Karim after Sheikh Russel striker Mfon Udoh missed a couple of scoring opportunities. Foysal Ahmed Fahim doubled Abahani's lead six minutes after restart with a placing shot on a square pass from Raphael Augusto.

"Lemos relishing Abahani-Mohammedan final | The Daily Star","""Coach Mario Lemos expressed his excitement after leading Abahani to the final of the Federation Cup against historic rivals Mohammedan following a 3-0 win over Sheikh Russel in the second semifinal at the Shaheed Dhirendra Nath Dutta Stadium in Cumilla yesterday. The final, to be held in Cumilla on May 30, will be the first Federation Cup final between the country's two most popular clubs in 14 years, with the Black and Whites winning the last battle at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in 2009. The two sides met later twice in cup finals during the 2009 Super Cup and 2011 Super Cup, with the Black and Whites winning the former and the Sky Blues having the last laugh two years later. Mohammedan's 2-1 win against favourites Bashundhara Kings in the first semifinal last week means this will be the first Dhaka Derby final in more than a decade, a prospect that excited Lemos. """"I'm very excited. It's a big game with a lot of history. I think it's a game that is going to get the gallery full. People who love football and love Mohammedan-Abahani, hopefully we can have a good game and show them that Bangladesh football is still alive,"""" the Portuguese told The Daily Star over phone following yesterday's victory. Abahani are the defending champions and record 12-time winners of the Federation Cup, which had been a traditional curtain-raiser in Bangladesh football in the past.

Both Abahani and Mohammedan are realistically out of contention for the Bangladesh Premier League title, with Abahani in second position, 10 points behind leaders Bashundhara Kings and Mohammedan sixth, a further 11 points behind. This is both teams' first chance to taste silverware this season, but Lemos was confident. """"I know it's not [going to be] easy, but when you are in a final, it's one game.

The 24-year-old Bangladeshi forward wrapped up the victory with a floated attempt that Sheikh Russel keeper Ashraful Islam Rana failed to keep out in the 71st minute. Lemos felt the team defended very well and were effective on the counterattack. """"Sheikh Russel are a very tough team to beat. We played three times against them.

"Federation Cup kicks off on Tuesday as coaches embrace new system | The Daily Star","""The Federation Cup, Bangladesh's premier cup competition, on Tuesday will usher into a new system that will see the tournament run for nearly seven months into the footballing season, unlike previous editions which ran for three-four weeks. Previously, the Federation Cup either commenced before or after the Bangladesh Premier League on the basis that players would be able to focus solely on competition at a time but the latest edition will be running simultaneously with the league challenging the participating teams to maintain focus on both competitions at the same time as Fed Cup games would now be played almost every week. The new arrangement is expected to bring more out of the players as well as the coaches as they would have to focus on both the Federation Cup and the league simultaneously. Despite the challenges, foreign and local coaches alike are seemingly happy with the introduction of the new system for the first time since the inception of the Federation Cup in 1980. """"The new long-term format of the Federation Cup goes in line with the idea to avoid injuries and accumulation of fatigue at the early stages of the season and we celebrate this positive idea as we want our players at the peak of their form throughout the year,"""" Bashundhara Kings' Spanish coach Oscar Bruzon told The Daily Star on Monday. Sheikh Jamal DC coach, Maruful Haque deemed the new system as a professional one that will test the man-management skills of the coaches. """"I think playing a tournament within the time frame of the league is a professional system where there will be one or two matches every week and it is the sole responsibility of the coaches how they will handle the man-management every week,"""" said country's lone UEFA A licensed coach. """"The coaches will then have to decide where to prioritise, the Federation Cup or the league,"""" said Maruful whose side have a Fed Cup fixture on Tuesday and then a league match on Friday.

"Bangladesh Football: Mohammedan seek unity","""With their image tarnished and performance in the field reaching its nadir, the once revered Mohammedan Sporting Club officials finally realised that it was about time to work together to revive the club's image. The first sign of that serious effort was on display at the club's Motijheel tent yesterday when former Mohammedan president Monirul Haque Chowdhury initiated a fruitful dialogue with the sitting board of directors of the club. “We all are responsible for this poor state of Mohammedan. But the bad times have allowed us to be united again. Mohammedan faced such a bad patch in 1977 but it bounced back in the next year and became unbeaten champions in football. It is time to be united in a bid to restore the pride of Mohammedan,” said Chowdhury after his meeting with the club's director-in-charge Lokman Hossain Bhuyian. “I was waiting for this day. We have discussed how we will be united and how we will work together. We want to form champion squads in both football and cricket in upcoming season. Our target is to produce good results in all the sports events we will be participating in,” Lokman responded. But Lokman, the man responsible for leading the club for the last six years, has miserably failed to uphold the image of the century-old club since it turned into a limited company in 2011. Among the three major sports – football, cricket and hockey, -- the once-popular club has managed just one trophy in hockey in the last six years. To add to the misery of its thousands of followers the Black and Whites hit the lowest ebb in their football history, finishing 10th among the 12 teams in the Bangladesh Premier League. They also finished fourth and fifth in Premier Hockey League and Premier Division Cricket League respectively. Lokman was responsible for a clear division among current and former club officials, players and supporters. It has also been alleged that the board of directors led by Lokman has been dithering to hold elections for different reasons. And yesterday's meeting was the first attempt to pave the way for a resolution of many pending issues that have been crippling the club for the last six years. However, rather than holding the existing board of directors accountable for the poor state of Mohammedan SC, unity among former and present club officials, former players and the supporters have been sought to pull the club out of the mire. Abdus Salam Murshedy, Badal Roy, Mozammel Haque Babu, FR Babul, Imtiaz Sultan Jony, Rummon Bin Wali Sabbir, Ilias Hossain, Jakaria Pintu, Protap Sangkar Hazra and Qumrun Nahar Dana are the few significant names who attended the meeting. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Kingsley was called in to Bangladesh's preliminary squad for the 2021 SAFF Championship but failed to make the cut in the final squad as Bangladesh Football Federation didn't risk being suspended. But, this time the game's local governing body is positive about defending Kingsley as a Bangladeshi player in case FIFA raises any issues. Bangladesh Premier League champions Bashundhara Kings had paved the way for Kingsley to play for Bangladesh by using him as a substitute player against Maziya and ATK Mohun Bagan during the 2022 AFC Cup in Kolkata.

"FIFA strikes Women's WC broadcast deal for 34 European countries | The Daily Star","""FIFA on Wednesday announced it had struck a deal with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to televise the 2023 Women's World Cup, avoiding a controversial blackout in the 'Big Five' European nations. The deal follows a standoff between the governing body of world football and broadcasters in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom over the rights for the competition in Australia and New Zealand in July and August. """"FIFA is delighted to widen the deal with the European Broadcasting Union for the transmission of the upcoming FIFA Women's World Cup to include the five major markets within their existing networks, namely France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as Ukraine, thus ensuring maximum exposure for the tournament,"""" said FIFA president Gianni Infantino on the football body's website. No financial details of the deal were announced. Infantino had been critical of broadcasters in the 'Big Five' European countries for offering substantially less than the amount paid to show the men's World Cup. One stumbling block in Europe was the time difference, which means that games will often be played in what is the early morning on the continent, but Infantino said that was no excuse. Last October, FIFA and EBU struck a deal for 28 countries. Wednesday's expanded 34-nation list omitted the names of several European nations competing at the World Cup: Sweden, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal. The deal with the EBU involved networks that broadcast free-to-air rather than subscription channels. FIFA listed ARD and ZDF in Germany, BBC and ITV in the UK, France Televisions, RAI in Italy and RTVE in Spain. In France M6, which is not part of the EBU, was also announced as a broadcaster.  'Most exciting and fastest growing' """"The FIFA Women's World Cup is one of sport's most exciting and fastest growing events and we are committed to working hand-in-hand with FIFA to ensure the women's game is enjoyed by as many people as possible across the continent,"""" said EBU director general Noel Curran. The Women's World Cup will be staged in Australia and New Zealand from July 20 to August 20 and will be the first to feature 32 teams. It will also see overall prize money for participating teams increased to $150 million, up sharply from $50 million in 2019 and a huge rise on the $15 million in 2015. The figure still pales in comparison to the $440 million prize money at the 32-team 2022 men's World Cup.

"Africa exceeds expectations at Women’s World Cup | The Daily Star","""Africa's run at the Women's World Cup has been nothing short of extraordinary at the end of the group phase on Thursday as debutants Morocco joined Nigeria and South Africa in the last 16. Morocco had been thrashed 6-0 by twice champions Germany in their opening match of the finals but bounced back to beat South Korea and Colombia to secure their passage into the knockout stage of the tournament. Their surprise run of results led to the group stage elimination of the highly fancied Germans in one of the biggest shocks of the tournament. The upset came some 24 hours after South Africa had snatched a dramatic stoppage time winner to oust Italy, and also after Nigeria had advanced from Group B following two draws and a win over co-hosts Australia. Even Zambia, who had been eliminated after two successive five-goal thrashings, were able to depart with a win, overcoming Costa Rica in their last group game. Africa's chances of getting a team through to the knockout phase were always going to be better with the expansion of the finals' field to 32 teams and the continent's representation increased to four. But even then, there was little expectation for the quartet of African teams as they travelled to Australia and New Zealand. Nigeria have not missed out of any of the nine Women's World Cups but their dominance in Africa had been ended as they struggled at last year's Africa Women's Cup of Nations and only finished fourth. South Africa won the continental title but their preparations were dogged by arguments over money as the players went on strike last month. As for Morocco, the first Arab nation to compete, they looked out of the depth as they produced a horror defensive display and looked every bit the 70 places they were ranked below Germany in a rude World Cup welcome. But they showed inspiring resolve to come back and win a top two place in Group H, albeit with some assistance as Germany failed to beat South Korea on Thursday. """"You've always got to factor in the magic of the World Cup,"""" their coach Reynald Pedros had predicted before the game. Morocco shook up the traditional order when finishing fourth in Qatar last December in Africa's best showing at the men's World Cup and the women now have a chance to also break new ground. No African team has ever won a knockout game at a previous Women's World Cup but there will be high hopes now that the continent's mazy run can continue, even if the odds are stacked against them.

"Wang keeps China's World Cup dreams alive in Haiti win | The Daily Star","""Wang Shuang kept China's Women's World Cup campaign alive by converting a penalty in Friday's 1-0 win over Haiti at Hindmarsh Stadium in Adelaide, with the Asian side showing great resolve to claim victory despite being a player short. The Steel Roses, who have three points from two games in Group D, face England on Tuesday. Haiti have no points after two defeats, but can also progress if they beat Denmark on the same day and other results go in their favour. China dominated possession from kick-off and almost went ahead in spectacular fashion in the 16th minute when Lou Jiahui managed to direct an acrobatic effort at goal, but the shot was tame and easily saved by Haiti goalkeeper Kerly Theus. However, the momentum quickly shifted when Zhang Rui was shown a straight red card in the 29th minute for a reckless 'studs up' tackle on Sherly Jeudy. The Caribbean side made the most of their advantage, having a goal disallowed for offside just before halftime, but China defended resolutely to guard themselves from relentless waves of attacks. Haiti substitute Melchie Dumornay then drew an excellent save from Zhu Yu with a side-footed shot early in the second half, but it was China who finally broke the deadlock, after Zhang Linyan was clumsily brought down by Ruthny Mathurin. Substitute Wang, the 2018 Asian Women's Footballer of the Year, stepped up to convert the resulting penalty in the 74th minute and give her side the advantage. Haiti pushed hard in search of an equaliser and had two penalty claims denied in a frantic closing spell, but China held on for the victory. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Jamaica dump Brazil and Marta out of World Cup to reach last 16 | The Daily Star","""Jamaica ensured there would be no fairytale ending to Marta's World Cup career as they strangled Brazil 0-0 to reach the last 16 on Wednesday and condemn the South Americans to their earliest exit since 1995. It was heartbreak for the legendary Brazilian attacker Marta, who at age 37 has said this would be her last World Cup. But it was joy for a Jamaica team who are yet to concede at the tournament and are into the knockout rounds for the first time in their history. Lorne Donaldson's unbeaten side will most likely meet Colombia next. Brazil had to win to be sure of going through, whereas Jamaica needed only to draw. So it was little surprise that it was the South Americans who had far the better of the first half in Melbourne. In front of a crowd of nearly 28,000, Brazil had more of the ball and attempts at goal -- Jamaica had none on target all game to Brazil's five. But for all that and with Marta starting, Jamaica were never really in serious trouble at any point in the game. Jamaica, who held France 0-0 before getting their first-ever World Cup win with a 1-0 victory over Panama, were defending deep and in numbers. Pia Sundhage's Brazil, who have never won the World Cup, looked short of ideas as they went to the break goalless. The second half was more of the same but Brazil were struggling to really create a golden chance. Khadija Shaw, the prolific Manchester City striker and Jamaica's undoubted star, was hardly seen as an attacking force.

"Nigeria qualify for Women's World Cup last 16 | The Daily Star","""Nigeria booked their place in the last 16 of the Women's World Cup on Monday when they drew 0-0 with Ireland to finish second behind co-hosts Australia in Group B. They will now meet the winners of Group D -- which is most likely to be European champions England. The Nigerians, who upset Australia 3-2 on their last visit to Brisbane, recovered from a sloppy first half to get the draw they needed and reach the knockout stage for only the third time in nine attempts. Australia beat Olympic champions Canada 4-0 in Melbourne to top the group. The Nigerians showed little of the flair that helped them down Australia in the last match, particularly during a scrappy first half during which they were outfought by an Ireland side only playing for pride after two losses. They found it hard to penetrate the Irish defensive line, with lone striker Asisat Oshoala a forlorn figure up front. Oshoala had only one chance in the first 45 minutes and should have put her side in front after latching onto a terrible backpass from Louise Quinn and finding herself one on one with keeper Courtney Brosnan. But her shot just missed to the right hand post and Ireland were off the hook. The Nigerians came out with far more purpose in the second half as the Irish seemed to begin to feel the pace of the first period. Brosnan pulled off a miraculous save in the 51st minute to deny Uchenna Kanu, who hit a powerful header that bounced awkwardly in front of the keeper. Brosnan then threw herself up to somehow tip the ball onto the underside of the bar and watch it bounce back into the field of play. That signalled an all-out assault on the Irish goal, only for some desperate defending to deny the Nigerians. However, in a match lacking quality, shots on goal were scarce, seven to Nigeria and four to Ireland, all of the Irish shots coming in the first half দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Roord on target as Dutch march past South Africa | The Daily Star","""Jill Roord scored her fourth goal of the tournament as the Netherlands marched into the quarter-finals of the Women's World Cup with a 2-0 win over South Africa at Sydney Football Stadium on Sunday. Roord's header gave her side an early lead and Lineth Beerensteyn added the second goal courtesy of a goalkeeping error in the second half to secure the Dutch a date with Spain in Wellington on Friday. The 54th-ranked African champions never gave up the fight in their first appearance in the World Cup knockout stage and were always a threat on the break through their lone striker Thembi Kgatlana. Dutch goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar was equal to everything Banyana Banyana fired at her, however, and the 2019 finalists progressed to the last eight for the second successive tournament. The noon kickoff - primetime in the United States - was tailor-made for the reigning champion Americans but they were packed off to Melbourne to face Sweden later on Sunday after the Netherlands hammered Vietnam 7-0 to win Group E. The Dutch started well and took the lead from a corner in the ninth minute when Danielle van de Donk headed the ball towards goal and defender Lebohang Ramalepe got in goalkeeper Kaylin Swart's way to present Roord with a simple finish. Banyana Banyana responded immediately, striker Thembi Kgatlana's fine first touch on a through ball giving her space to unleash a shot that forced a save out of Van Domselaar. Kgatlana was a constant warning to the Dutch against complacency. She got three shots away in the 10 minutes before halftime that tested Van Domselaar, who also had to be at her best to stop a Kholosa Biyana piledriver in stoppage time. Ten minutes into the second half, winger Lieke Martens had a goal disallowed for offside, but the Dutch did double the lead in the 68th minute. Beerensteyn was played through and shot across Swart, who appeared to have the everything under control but fumbled her catch and watched the ball squirt into the net. South Africa again responded to conceding a goal but Van Domselaar was again equal to it, getting down low to turn Linda Motlhalo's low drive around the post five minutes later. Banyana Banyana had one last chance to get on the scoreboard in stoppage time, almost inevitably through Kgatlana, but there was no way past Van Domselaar. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Australia pledges $128 mln for women's sport after maiden WC semifinal | The Daily Star","""Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Saturday promised A$200 million ($128 million) for women's sport in the wake of the Matildas' run to a maiden Women's World Cup semifinals. The Maltildas face Sweden in the third-place playoff for the bronze medal on Saturday night in Brisbane, after a 3-1 loss to England on Wednesday ended their best-ever run at the tournament. The success has sparked calls for more funding of women's soccer in Australia, which has struggled in a market dominated by Australian Rules football and rugby league. Albanese said the funds would be used to improve sports facilities and equipment for women and girls, with soccer tipped to need """"significant resourcing"""" following the Matildas' standout World Cup campaign. The government would also work to ensure """"iconic"""" women's sporting events like the World Cup semi final were available for Australians to watch for free, he said, after criticism that many World Cup games were behind paywalls. """"The Matildas have given us a moment of national inspiration, this is about seizing that opportunity for the next generation, investing in community sporting facilities for women and girls around Australia,"""" he said in a statement. """"We want women and girls everywhere in Australia to have the facilities and the support to choose a sport they love."""" The government tipped A$44 million into hosting the World Cup. A further $40 million was allocated for grass-roots programmes and to help fund the Matildas' recently-opened training base in Melbourne. Even so, after Australia's defeat to England captain Sam Kerr called for more funding to ensure the World Cup was more than just a sugar rush for women's soccer in Australia. The nation's football governing body, Football Australia, welcomed the funding boost, with CEO James Johnson saying it had arrived """"at a poignant moment"""". """"With the FIFA Women's World Cup reaching new heights, we anticipate a further surge of up to 20% in grassroots participation,"""" Johnson said in a statement.

"Messi called up for Argentina qualifiers despite injury | The Daily Star","""Argentina have called up Lionel Messi for their upcoming South American World Cup qualifiers despite him being on the injured list at his club Inter Miami. Messi missed Inter's 4-1 defeat to Chicago on Wednesday as he continues to struggle with his fitness -- he has played just 37 minutes for the club since September 3. Argentina host Paraguay on October 12 and then travel to play Peru five days later in CONMEBOL qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup. The 36-year-old has missed Inter's last three games and five of their last six but little detail has been given about his physical condition. Miami's Argentine coach Gerardo 'Tata' Martino initially said Messi was struggling with """"muscle fatigue"""" but later referred to him being troubled by """"scars"""" from an old injury. The captain of Argentina's World Cup winning team last year in Qatar, Messi played and scored in his country's 1-0 win over Ecuador in Buenos Aires on September 7. He asked to be substituted in the final minutes of that game and then missed the game, five days later, against Bolivia in La Paz, watching his team-mates from the sidelines. Without Messi, Miami have failed to win their last three games, as their bid to reach the MLS playoffs has faltered. Wednesday's game in Chicago was moved to Soldier Field, the home of the NFL's Chicago Bears and drew a crowd of 62,124 with many buying tickets in the hope of seeing the seven-times Ballon d'Or winner.

"Real fight back to win five-goal thriller at Napoli | The Daily Star","""Real Madrid fought back to secure a barnstorming 3-2 win at Napoli in their Champions League Group C clash on Tuesday, with the Italian side's keeper Alex Meret scoring an unfortunate own goal to hand the Spaniards victory late in the second half. Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham were both on target for Real in the first half to cancel out a Leo Ostigard header for Napoli, but a Piotr Zielinski penalty early in the second half drew the Italian side level. Real scored the winner in the 78th minute as a stunning long-range shot from Federico Valverde cannoned off the crossbar straight onto the back of the flailing Meret's head before deflecting into his own goal. Real are top of Group C on six points from two games, three ahead Napoli and Braga. Union Berlin are bottom with no points. While there were frazzled nerves at the end, Real started the game strongly with the Vinicius and Bellingham creating all kinds of trouble for the hosts' defence. It was Vinicius's second game back from a leg injury that sidelined him for more than a month and he looked explosive, constantly linking up with Bellingham as they rekindled their early-season chemistry. Both had chances to score in the opening minutes but it was Napoli who ended up taking the lead with Ostigard's header in the 19th minute after Real Madrid keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga failed to punch clear a corner lifted into a crowded six-yard box. The visitors, however, recovered with strikes from Vinicius and Bellingham within seven first-half minutes. First Bellingham intercepted a hospital pass by Napoli defender Giovanni Di Lorenzo just outside their penalty area and linked up quickly with Vinicius, who slotted a brilliant angled strike into the far corner in the 27th minute. DAZZLING EFFORT Bellingham put Real ahead in the 34th minute with a dazzling effort, dribbling past three Napoli defenders, before guiding a tidy finish out of the goalkeeper's reach and into the bottom left corner. But Napoli came back into the game early in the second half and levelled in the 54th minute with Zielinski'spenalty, awarded for a handball by defender Nacho after a VAR check. Real's players and coach Carlo Ancelotti were furious with the decision and complained vociferously to referee Clement Turpin, who had first turned down the penalty appeals and waved play on, with the ball seemingly deflecting off Nacho's boot before hitting his left hand as he slid in to tackle. """"I don't think it's a penalty. It's a rebound from his foot, you can't just cut the hand off the player,"""" Ancelotti told Movistar Plus. Roared on by their fans in a sold-out Diego Maradona stadium, the hosts pushed for the win and almost scored with a Khvicha Kvaratskhelia strike that went just wide while Arrizabalaga made three fine saves from Victor Osimhen's close-range efforts. However, veteran midfielder Luka Modric climbed off the bench to liven up Real Madrid late in the game. He first put it on a plate for Bellingham, who missed a sitter from close range in the 75th minute. Three minutes later, his corner ended up at the feet of Valverde whose long-range effort found the net off Meret's head. """"Modric has delivered.

"Madrid comeback to stay perfect, Ramos enjoys Sevilla return | The Daily Star","""Real Madrid came from behind to beat Real Sociedad 2-1 and climb back to the top of La Liga on Sunday, maintaining their perfect start to the season. Earlier Sergio Ramos made his second Sevilla debut in a narrow win over Las Palmas, while Mason Greenwood played his first match for Getafe, on loan from Manchester United. After Barcelona put five past Real Betis in a flashy display on Saturday the onus was on Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid side to maintain their 100 percent record and they did, against the tricky Basque visitors. Propelled by the electric Takefusa Kubo, Real Sociedad took an early lead through Ander Barrenetxea, but Madrid hit back with goals from Fede Valverde and Joselu to earn their fifth win from five games. England international Jude Bellingham was unable to continue his excellent goalscoring form, after netting five goals in his first four Madrid matches, but remains the division's top goalscorer. Madrid start their Champions League campaign on Wednesday at home against Union Berlin, and despite losing Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema in the summer and star player Vinicius Junior to injury, remain a force to be reckoned with. """"We started by letting in a goal and the good thing is that we were capable of turning it around -- the bad thing is that we have to avoid that,"""" said Ancelotti. """"We did it thanks to the commitment, energy and will of the team, we have an intensity that opponents find hard to cope with for 90 minutes."""" The Basque visitors went ahead at the new-look Santiago Bernabeu after only five minutes, when Kubo stroked a fine pass into Barrenetxea's path. Kepa Arrizabalaga kept out his first effort with a fine save but could not claw out the second. Kubo then beat the goalkeeper with a brilliant strike but it was disallowed for offside. Joselu hit the crossbar with the goal gaping and Alex Remiro denied Dani Carvajal as Madrid found their footing. Valverde slammed Real Madrid level less than a minute into the second half, lashing Fran Garcia's cut-back in off the post from outside the area. The left-back created the second goal too, crossing for target man Joselu to nod the hosts ahead at the back post. Spain international Joselu was immediately taken off for Eduardo Camavinga, as Ancelotti sought more control of the game. The Italian got it too, with the visitors effectively shut down, no longer finding spaces between Madrid lines. """"This is the Bernabeu and with our fans we turned it around,"""" said Joselu. """"We're doing a bit of everything, we're confident in ourselves, there's a lot of quality in the squad and we came from behind again."""" Madrid lead Barcelona by two points, with both of Spain's giants unbeaten, although the Catalans drew their opening game against Getafe. - 'Die happy' - Sergio Ramos played for Sevilla for the first time since he left the club in 2005 as they earned their first win of the season over Las Palmas. The 37-year-old centre-back started in the 1-0 victory at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, following his arrival from Paris Saint-Germain this summer. Ramos, who left Sevilla for Real Madrid 18 years ago to the ire of many supporters in Andalucia, was cheered on his return. Belgian winger Dodi Lukebakio sent Sevilla ahead after 71 minutes and with Ramos patrolling, they kept their first clean sheet of the campaign. """"I felt a lot of emotion ... it was amazing to find my people again, my home, my fans, it's unique,"""" Ramos told Movistar. The defender admitted some nerves about how fans would treat him after playing at a rival club for so long. """"I had a few doubts at first but the reception I had on my arrival, I will take to the grave ... now I can die happy,"""" he added. Elsewhere Pacheta got off to a winning start as Villarreal's new coach thanks to Alexander Sorloth's 94th minute winner against Almeria in a 2-1 victory. Getafe edged Osasuna 3-2, with Greenwood making his debut, and his first appearance since January 2022. The English striker, on loan at Getafe from Manchester United, was charged with attempted rape and assault in October 2022 but the charges were later dropped. Getafe coach Jose Bordalas sent Greenwood on in the 77th minute to applause from home fans at the club's Coliseum Alfonso Perez stadium. A group of Osasuna supporters greeted the 21-year-old's arrival to Spanish football with chants of """"Greenwood, die"""". """"I didn't hear them so I have nothing to say,"""" said Bordalas.

"Football: Ramos sees reverse in fortunes as Real's record run ends","""Sergio Ramos has so often been Real Madrid's man of the moment but the captain saw the tables turn as his own goal helped his former club Sevilla to a 2-1 win over the La Liga leaders on Sunday, ending a record-breaking 40-game unbeaten run. The Real defender's reputation for rescuing his team in their hour of need took a twist when he headed Pablo Sarabia's floated free-kick past his own goalkeeper Keylor Navas in the 85th minute to cancel out Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty. His lapse sparked a late surge from Sevilla, who won with an added time strike from Montenegro forward Stevan Jovetic. He joined Sevilla on loan only last week from Inter Milan after an unhappy spell and an unsuccessful two years at Manchester City. Locally born Ramos made his debut for Sevilla in 2004 before joining Real a year later aged 19 for 27 million euros ($28.70 million). He was reminded of the bitterness fans still harbour over his departure when on Sunday he arrived at the Sanchez Pizjuan to banners reading: """"This will never be your home."""" Ramos had further riled Sevilla supporters three days earlier for goading a section of the stadium after scoring a penalty in Thursday's 3-3 draw in the King's Cup, prompting Real to release a statement defending him, but the home fans predictably delighted in his misery after the own goal. """"This is always one of the most difficult stadiums to play in but when I go on to the pitch I try and forget about these things. The own goal was just one moment, overall this was one of my best ever performances for Real Madrid,"""" Ramos said. """"We didn't relax, we didn't know how to manage the game and everything changed with one free-kick. We didn't kill the game off but we can leave here with our heads held high. We can't blame anyone, when we lose we all lose."""" Real had the chance to go five points clear of Barcelona and seven ahead of Sevilla but instead saw their lead cut to a point over Jorge Sampaoli's second-placed side and two ahead of Barca, although they have played one game fewer than both sides. Real manager Zinedine Zidane said his side still had plenty to be positive about despite surrendering their remarkable unbeaten record run, with a King's Cup quarter-final first leg with Celta Vigo coming up in midweek. """"I don't think this will affect us although we'll find out on Wednesday. We have to digest this defeat because no-one likes losing, especially after playing this well for 85 minutes, but we have to accept it,"""" said Zidane, who defended Ramos.

During Saturday's meeting of the NTC, a few names of local and foreign coaches came up, but the committee emphasised on a coach who has a good idea about Bangladesh's football and is familiar with the players. Kottan fitted the bill perfectly and was preferred over former national coaches Lodewijk de Kruif and Maruful Haque. The NTC is scheduled to sit again today to finalise the details of the contract with Kottan, the appointment of an assistant coach and the starting date of a training camp. As Kottan, who has already been informed about his possible appointment, may arrive in the capital in early February, the training camp is likely to be deferred further.

"We have to look forward | Bangladesh world cup 2023 squad | The Daily Star","""Former Bangladesh captain and BCB director Khaled Mahmud Sujon requested everybody to keep faith in the team, which was announced yesterday for the ICC World Cup.

"Hello chaos my old friend | Bangladesh at the Cricket World Cup | The Daily Star","""We've been here before. A World Cup looming, fans desperately trying to gauge how Bangladesh will perform in the showpiece event. You reach a consensus, perhaps to the tune of """"they will get blown away this year"""" or, at the other end of the spectrum, """"they're playing well, they might just conjure something"""". And then the Tigers do the opposite. Consider the track record. Leading up to the country's first World Cup appearance in England in 1999, the Tigers played the Asia Cup and a few international triangulars. Against the big boys, a score of 180 not all out was creditable, and Bangladesh struggled to beat Kenya. The stage was set for a hammering in the World Cup played in the unfamiliar conditions of England and Wales, right?  Wrong. Bangladesh beat Scotland, a fellow minnow, and Pakistan, the eventual runners-up and till that shock result against Bangladesh, the form team of the tournament. Come South Africa 2003, Bangladesh were drawn in a group with Canada and Kenya. Having been elevated to Test status three years earlier, Bangladesh were part of cricket's big-boy table and those other teams were not. So, at least one confirmed win, given what they did in the last World Cup? Wrong again -- losses to everyone bar West Indies, as that match was rained out. Their worst performance in the tournament history. In the next global showpiece in the West Indies, they were drawn with India, Sri Lanka and Bermuda in a group from which two would progress. No chance? Think again. In a tournament-altering result, the Tigers knocked India out and then beat South Africa in the Super Eights, before doing the decent thing and not making it to the semifinals.  This pattern goes on. At home in 2011, with a buildup that consisted of beating New Zealand 4-0 and a rising trend in performance in home matches, you could have been forgiven for being in the """"might just conjure something"""" camp. Fifty-eight all out against the West Indies, 78 all out against South Africa, and as one of the host nations, Bangladesh could not finish even in the top eight. Not even close. Fast forward to 2015 in Australia. The previous year was among the worst in Bangladesh's history, with the Tigers losing anything that could be lost, and then coming up with ways to lose matches that seemed impossible not to win (having Sri Lanka 67 for eight, then losing by 13 runs in Mirpur, for a dire example). But then they went on to play the quarterfinals in Australia, with Rubel Hossain's memorable demolition of England and Mahmudullah Riyad's consecutive tons against England and New Zealand the standout memories.  Let's waste the least amount of space recounting the latest, as it is freshest. One of the fastest improving teams under Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, the Tigers won their maiden multi-team trophy on the eve of the 2019 World Cup, but then finished eighth out of 10 teams when it mattered. This time, even neutrals were giving them a fair chance of making a deep run. With the above summary of World Cups past, you may find a pattern, that they seem to shine in alternate World Cups, or that they can reliably be expected to do the opposite of what is expected. But the wider picture, the wider pattern, is of chaos and inconsistency. Things have been glossed over in the aforementioned retrospective. In 2007, they KO'd India and South Africa, but in the other outings were comprehensively outplayed, even by their 2007 standards.  In 2011, apart from the abject displays against the West Indies and South Africa, there was hope for a while with victories over the Netherlands, Ireland and a particularly rousing and exciting one over England. Memories of 2015 glories must be tempered by the fact that a quarterfinal finish, in all likelihood, was made possible by a fortunate washout against hosts and eventual champions Australia. And lastly, in 2019 before the gloomy end in Lord's came the brightest of beginnings at The Oval, when Bangladesh beat South Africa, then almost defeated eventual finalists New Zealand, and then pulled off a successful 300-plus chase over the West Indies in Taunton. So, what is the expectation for India 2023? Why are we even asking? What could possibly be the answer? We could say that Bangladesh were as high as third in the 2023 World Cup race, but then we'd have to say they are seventh in the current ODI rankings. We could say that under Tamim Iqbal a relatively stable team had been improving since the last World Cup, but after that thing that happened when he retired, unretired and then quit captaincy, stability is not the word.  We could say that they won series against South Africa away from home and India at home, but then they lost to Afghanistan at home, and were unable to bat even 40 overs on an absolute belter of a pitch against Pakistan in the recently concluded Asia Cup. The simplest thing, and closest to the truth, to say is that we do not know. The BCB does not know, the players do not know, neither do sports writers or fans. We do not know what surprises the World Cup squad will hold. It will probably be announced a minute before players are asked to leave for the airport. Will it affect them? Not likely. By now they have probably figured out the only reliable pattern, that there will be chaos. We should too, and embrace it. At least, going by past tournaments, it won't be boring.

"BCB to make major decisions today | The Daily Star","""The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is set to take a few major decisions today, including determining the new ODI captain, in a meeting that will be presided over by the board president Nazmul Hassan Papon in Mirpur. As things stand, star allrounder Shakib Al Hasan is in pole position to take up the reins of the Tigers' ODI unit as Papon mentioned on Saturday that appointing Shakib would be the 'easiest choice' keeping in mind the Asia Cup later this month and the ODI World Cup in India in October-November. According to sources, Papon and other board members will discuss the matter with Shakib, skipper of the Test and T20I sides, today and get his opinion on being in charge of the ODI side as well after Tamim Iqbal stepped down from the role last week. Coach Chandika Hathurusingha is also slated to return to the country today, and the Sri Lankan is expected to be present in the vital meeting. It was also learned that the selectors are expected to announce the 20-22 member preliminary squad today before revealing the main squad for the Asia Cup. Apart from Shakib, wicketkeeper-batter and vice captain of the ODI side, Liton Das, was also considered as an option for the captaincy role. However, it was learned that the board remains concerned over handing the player the burden of leading the side in major events like the Asia Cup and the World Cup, especially considering his underwhelming form in the past year. The captaincy issue aside, the board will also discuss appointing the team director for the upcoming events, with former Bangladesh captain and BCB director Khaled Mahmud Sujon reportedly being considered to assume the role once again. The board is also likely to discuss the inclusion of experienced Mahmudullah Riyad in the squad for the upcoming flagship events. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Tanzim’s Misogynistic Posts: BCB parrots player’s defence, says he is sorry | Tanzim Sakib’s Viral Misogynistic Post On Women’s Rights | The Daily Star","""Four days after screenshots of Bangladesh pacer Tanzim Hasan Sakib's misogynistic social media posts went viral, Bangladesh Cricket Board faced the media yesterday, but could only offer what amounted to a mere apology on the player's behalf. As of late last night, Tanzim himself did not apologise directly for the posts that questioned the right to employment and freedom of at least half the country's population. Moreover, in the course of yesterday's press conference, BCB Cricket Operations Committee Chairman Jalal Yunus's words raised doubts about whether the sport's national governing body indeed understood the extent of the problem and damage Tanzim's posts caused. """"About the posts on women, he [Tanzim] said 'I take responsibility for this' … He said, 'My mother is a woman; I can never be a misogynist'."""" Jalal was repeating what Tanzim had supposedly said during a """"discussion"""" with BCB officials regarding the posts. The cricket operations chairman said Tanzim told them he did not make the posts to hurt anyone, and that if his posts did hurt anyone, """"he was sorry for that"""". He also said they would monitor Tanzim's activities from now on, and that they had cautioned him. In that, there was a tacit admission that there was no monitoring of a young cricketer's activities on social media thus far – a cricketer who came under BCB's wing at a tender age. In September 2022, Tanzim said in a post on Facebook that women being gainfully employed deprived their husbands and children of their rights, and brought ruin to family and society. More recently, he said in a post that if one married a woman habituated to """"free mixing"""" addas, he would be depriving his children of a modest mother. These were the two posts that went viral after Tanzim, an Under-19 World Cup winner in 2019, bowled superbly on his ODI debut to help deliver a consolation win against India in the Asia Cup on Friday. He has deleted both posts, but not before those garnered hundreds of comments expressing approval and support. A national cricketer may thus have influenced many others to follow a line of thinking that, according to the BCB, he has now apologised for. The BCB is a signatory to the International Cricket Council's anti-discrimination policy, in which the sport's global governing body says that all of its members should """"not at any time offend, insult, humiliate, intimidate, threaten, disparage, vilify or unlawfully discriminate between persons based on their race, religion, culture, colour, descent, nationality, ethnic origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status and/or maternity status"""". The cricket board also has a code of conduct that contracted players must abide by. Although Tanzim is not yet on the list of those players, a BCB official, preferring anonymity, said a player comes under the code of conduct once he or she plays for the national cricket team. This code of conduct includes instructions on how to conduct media interactions and what he can or cannot say publicly, according to the BCB official. But the BCB apparently does not think his indiscretions warrant a public apology, nor any kind of official censure. Jalal said they would definitely take action if Tanzim did something like this again. """"He said he was sorry. He said he would refrain from making such posts in the future,"""" Jalal said. """"As he has admitted his mistake … he said a big thing -- he is not a misogynist. He said 'My mother is a woman; how can I be a misogynist?'"""" Tanzim's surge to fame and national popularity apparently increased people's scrutiny of his activities, and the BCB moved to address it only after that scrutiny caused an uproar that refused to die down. That they then chose, not once but twice, to parrot one of the most transparently disingenuous defences against the charge of misogyny, that one can't hate women because their mother is a woman (as if there are exceptions to that reality), is a disservice to women, obviously, but also to Tanzim. A mitigating factor in Tanzim's discriminatory speech can be that he is just 20 years old and therefore not yet quite hardened enough to be immune to bigoted influences. But what of the apparently wise old heads in the BCB? Have they provided him any guidance since the time he came under their guardianship as an impressionable mid-teen? The cricket operations that Jalal oversees involve both men and women cricketers. By choosing to make excuses for Tanzim, what message is he sending to the women cricketers who have arguably brought more plaudits for the nation than their male counterparts? The BCB had an opportunity to set an emphatic example yesterday against discrimination and misogyny. They could easily have pointed out the error in Tanzim's assertions – he lives and plies his trade in a country that earns a chunk of its foreign currency through a majority-female workforce in the RMG sector, a country that prides itself on women empowerment, and one that has been led by women for the past 32 years. They could have arranged for Tanzim to make a public apology on the platform where his posts brought out similarly misogynistic echoes. The governing body could also have made a statement about the fact that he is a role model, and as such the """"freedom of speech"""" argument offered does not hold. As a national cricketer, who earned the blue check beside his name because of his status, Tanzim has a greater responsibility than the ordinary social media user. That BCB's policy and code of conduct implementation is failing the cricketers and the nation at large was exemplified by a more senior national cricketer, Mehedi Hasan Miraz. The all-rounder, who has been part of the national team for the last seven years, posted on Facebook in defence of Tanzim yesterday evening, before deleting it a short while later. If Mehedi, who has played 146 matches and is talked about as a future captain, does not know better than to inflame sentiments with his social media presence, what hope was there for Tanzim or others of his scant experience? There is precedent for taking action in such cases. England bowler Ollie Robinson, having taken seven wickets in his debut Test in 2021, was banned for eight matches after racist and misogynistic Tweets from a decade ago resurfaced. In taking the action, the England and Wales Cricket Board sent a strong message of zero tolerance against hate speech. The BCB missed that opportunity yesterday. Instead, they chose to talk about how mothers cannot birth misogynists. That is true to an extent. Misogynists are not born; they are shaped by the ills of society and the indifference of those in power, and unfortunately, the BCB yesterday played its part to that end. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Exciting third day awaits in NCL | The Daily Star","""Two out of four National Cricket League Round 2 matches between Dhaka Division-Rangpur and Dhaka Metropolis-Khulna are expected to see results on the third day of the ongoing first-class competition following today's play. The Tier 1 encounter at the Shaheed Chandu Stadium in Bogura, Rangpur needed 113 runs to win and will resume the day on 98 for 3, chasing the target of 211 runs set by Dhaka. Rangpur pacer Musfik Hasan bagged eight wickets to bundle out Dhaka for 199 runs on their second innings after resuming the day on 88 without loss. The right-arm seamer ended up with figures of eight for 73 from 17.5 overs, while Mahidul Islam Ankon top-scored with 74 for Dhaka. At the BKSP-3 ground in Tier 2, Dhaka Metropolis need 152 runs with eight wickets in hand against Khulna. Chasing a target of 200, Dhaka ended the day on 48 for 2, where opener Azmir Ahmed will resume the third day on 25 runs. Earlier, Khulna were all out on 253 runs in their second innings as Imran Uzzaman missed out his hundred for just eight runs after a 193-ball 92. Resuming the second day on eight for three, Imran steered the ship for Khulna and Jawad Royen also scored a fifty for the batting side. Aminul Islam and Sharifullah picked up three wickets each while Abu Hider and Rakibul Hasan scalped a brace for Dhaka. Elsewhere in a Tier 1 game, Zakir Hasan smashed his maiden double hundred as Sylhet declared their first innings after posting a huge total of 481 for nine. The left-handed keeper-batter resumed the second day on 132 and went on to achieve the feat before eventually getting dismissed for 213 off 318 deliveries, laced with 18 fours and two sixes. Left-arm spinner Hasan Murad picked a fifer for Chattogram. In reply, Chattogram scored 98 for one at stumps with opener Pinak Ghosh and Parvez Hossain Emon will resume the third day on 49 and 45, respectively. At the Sheikh Abu Naser stadium in Khulna during a Tier 2 fixture, Rajshahi declared the first innings after posting a huge 518 for nine, riding on three centuries, as Junaid Siddique and Jahurul Islam added a record 333 runs for the opening wicket. Jahurul was dismissed top-scoring with 177 runs, while Junaid scored 149 runs off 369 deliveries. Experienced Mushfiqur Rahim, however, missed out on 32 runs while young Pritom Kumar remained unbeaten on 101 as Rajshahi posted a mammoth first-innings total. Barishal, in reply, scored 79 for two at stumps where Salman Hossain (44 not out) and Abu Sayem (30 not out) will resume the third day as they trail by 429 runs. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"National Cricket League (NCL): BCB beep-ing to the right beat","""The recent fuss in the country's cricket fraternity seems to be over the Bangladesh Cricket Board's newly-set requirements for the beep test that must be met in order to play in the National Cricket League (NCL), scheduled to begin next month. The BCB announced that the players would need to score at least 11 points in the beep test in order to be allowed to play in the NCL this year, although the BCB had allowed players with scores as low as 9 to participate in the domestic circuit last year. This leap in the required level of fitness was done after head coach Russell Domingo was left shocked by the fitness of Bangladesh players earlier this week. """"'What sort of fitness is this?'"""" Domingo, who himself said that he had not seen such poor fitness from players at the international level, was quoted as saying by BCB president Nazmul Hassan. Although the decision from the BCB seems to be right on cue given the urge to increase the standard of cricket in the domestic circuit, the sudden bump in fitness requirement was labelled unfair by a few players who have been out of the national side for a while. """"If a player scores 14 in the beep test but has no ability to perform in a game, then what is the use of such a score?"""" said 33-year old pacer Mohammad Sharif, who thought fitness should not be an issue if a player performs well despite lacking that department. One may argue that the level of competence required in the domestic circuit cannot be compared to that needed in international matches. But is it not necessary to implement required standards at the lower levels so players from the pipeline who get into the national squad are not suddenly asked to meet a new standard? When writing about the fitness levels required in Bangladesh, the scenario worldwide should also come to the fore. India only allows a player to stay in the national team if he has a minimum score of 16.1 in yo-yo test, a test inspired by the beep test but slightly different. In both the tests, athletes run to exhaustion while completing a multi-stage 20m shuttle run test. However, yo-yo tests have a rest period after every 40 metres (2x20m) covered compared to the beep test, which is continuous. The world's top-ranked Test side, India, are even considering increasing the minimum qualification mark from 16.1 to 17 before their tour of South Africa next month. And such a move would be no surprise for a team led by Virat Kohli, who aced their recent yo-yo test with a score of 19. Pakistan and Sri Lanka's minimum level for the yo-yo test is now 17.4. West Indies set the mark at 19 while England and New Zealand have a bare minimum of 19 as the required level to be considered for the international side. A score of 11.6 in the beep test is equivalent to an 18.3 in the yo-yo test. Considering the current scenario and fitness levels required by other top international cricket teams, it is evident that BCB are on the right track. In September 2016, Bangladesh players were reported to have an average of 11 -- their all-time high fitness levels -- in the beep test. And maybe it is time for players to realise that if they are to compete at the highest level, it is time to convert their peak scores into regular ones. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Liton has his work cut out to recover consistency | The Daily Star","""Liton Das is a natural stroke-maker and when such batters struggle even for short periods, naturally a lot of questions regarding lack of form also arrive. Despite not being completely out of runs, the manner of Liton's dismissals over the past few months have been a concern for the Bangladesh team management. With major tournaments such as Asia Cup and the World Cup to come, Liton's form is a big area of dependency for the Tigers as a strong start from the top-order is required when wickets favour batters. Liton scored 152 in seven innings in the Global T20 league in Canada at an average of over 21 and strike-rate of just over 100. His LPL stint of three games saw him average just over 11, managing 34 runs at a strike-rate of 113.33. Yesterday, head coach Chandika Hathurusingha too was asked to address the """"concern"""" regarding the vice-captain's form. Chandika, though, felt that the recent T20 performances in franchise leagues were not an apt indicator. """"I have no concerns about his form at the moment because he's played in a few competitions in Canada and in Sri Lanka. Those are T20s. But he's training really hard. """"If you look at those recent tournaments that he played, the pitches are not that great, not high scoring, especially in Canada; and to a certain extent in Sri Lanka. So, whatever the runs he scored were impact runs,"""" Chandika said at the press conference yesterday. What Liton's role would be as an opener, apart from being able to see off the new ball is still a tactically nuanced question. But the head coach insinuated there was a plan regarding his role. """"Yes, we want him to play a different, like a big role, during the Asia Cup and the World Cup. So, hope that he will show."""" Liton was phenomenal across formats last year but averages just over 30 this year. Despite the three fifties this year, including one in his last ODI while playing Afghanistan, even the team management feel Liton has been a little off. A part of the issue has been getting starts and not being able to carry on. \ """"He [Liton] thinks that he could have done much better. So, we also think that he's capable of doing more than what he's showing us,"""" Hathurusingha said. Liton shared his recent struggles with childhood mentor Montu Dutta, who had coached Liton during his BKSP days. The coach divulged that there were some issues with Liton's movements during the shots he was trying to execute. """"I talked to him today regarding some of his movements. While playing spin, his shoulder does not get down and I suggested some things,"""" he told members of the media after watching Liton bat at the nets yesterday in Mirpur. In recent times, Liton has been getting out to awkward shots of good-length deliveries. The coach tried to provide an explanation. """"While playing the shot, if the head isn't somewhat down, you won't be able to execute the perfect shot. To get on top of the delivery and be able to judge it properly, I talked to him about why his foot movement wasn't happening. """"It's not a big problem but a small thing is becoming big in stature. He discussed that sometimes he was hitting deliveries that aren't there to be hit. We discussed how to mentally prepare to avoid these things,"""" he added. Montu felt that Liton needed a few drills to get going before delving into focused net sessions. For now, apart from the technical adjustments, it would be those mental preparations that can set Liton towards the kind of run-scoring he showed last year. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Of flickering flames and misleading hype | The Daily Star","""Prior to the 16th edition of Asia Cup, the continent's biggest cricket event, there were high hopes surrounding three-time finalists Bangladesh. The Tigers, however, only returned home with a comprehensive victory over Afghanistan and a consolation win over India. Yet, the latter came as more than a consolation to the team management as it gave Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan and coach Chandika Hathurusingha enough confidence to present an optimistic picture ahead of the World Cup. While Shakib warned after India's triumph that they will be """"a dangerous side in the World Cup"""", Chandika labelled it as """"huge"""" boost for the Tigers heading into the showpiece event. Bangladesh began their campaign with a demoralising loss against Sri Lanka, but bounced back strongly against Afghanistan to earn a Super Four spot. The ghost of their opening match's batting debacle resurfaced in the first two Super Four matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, prompting Shakib to remark, """"We really needed this reality check before the World Cup"""". It was undoubtedly refreshing as Shakib and co regained their confidence following a nail-biting six-run win against India, who rested important players such as Virat Kohli and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the dead rubber. A thrilling win against India is always pleasant, and it was great to see skipper Shakib finally leading from the front in the tournament, earning the player-of-the-match award in the process. The most satisfying scene was the performance of a young pacer, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, in his maiden game. If his first spell suggests a promising future, his composure in the last over will be remembered for a long time. Nothing was wrong with Hathurusingha heaping praise on unlikely heroes in Mahedi Hasan and Nasum Ahmed, who stood up to give team management food for thought as they look to finalise World Cup squad by September 28. Moreover, Shakib commended Towhid Hridoy the other day, and the batter deserved it. Another player worthy of praise is Mehedi Hasan Miraz who strengthened his reputation as a utility cricketer. As a team, though, the Tigers fell short of their goals for the event. Their performance did not live up to the claim, made by the head coach, of being """"one of the best sides in its history"""". If we recall what Hathurusingha remarked to broadcasters earlier this year, we must conclude that the Tigers were underachievers. """"We have started the road map for the Asia Cup, Bangladesh's side is among the best in its history. We have the best opportunity to do something that Bangladesh haven't done before,"""" said the Bangladesh coach before the third day of play in the one-off Test between Bangladesh and Afghanistan in Mirpur in June. But Bangladesh's team resorted to come up with a defence for their inconsistent show. Shakib stated after the India match, """"Lots of injuries, and players coming in and out didn't help during this Asia Cup."""" Injury setbacks, now a normal occurrence in world cricket, cannot be an excuse for a side who claimed to be one of the best sides in their history. A team cannot prosper in a global event unless it has a greater pool of players, as Sri Lanka does, contending for a spot in the eleven. While speaking to local media prior to their departure to Sri Lanka, Shakib refused to correlate Asia Cup displays to the World Cup; although he did say that they may take confidence from excellent performances in the continental event. The all-rounder also stated that they will not be discouraged if they do not perform well in the Asia Cup, adding, """"Even if we do well, it does not mean our chances for the World Cup will improve.""""

They were already number one in Tests and T20 internationals. Only South Africa in 2012 have previously achieved the feat, according to the International Cricket Council.

"Yadav closing in on Babar in T20I rankings| The Daily Star","""Babar Azam is in danger of losing his mantle as the best T20I batter in the world after emerging India star Suryakumar Yadav moved within striking distance of the Pakistan captain on the latest MRF Tyres ICC Men's Player Rankings. Yadav has been in fine form for India during their ongoing T20I series against West Indies and the 31-year-old's latest exploits with the bat has seen him rewarded on the latest rankings update. The ICC released their weekly update of the rankings on Wednesday and Yadav surged up three spots to second overall on the T20I list for batters, with Babar now just two rating points ahead of the in-form right-hander. Yadav only made his international debut at the start of last year and his rapid recent rise has come on the back of a century against England in Nottingham last month and a stylish half-century against West Indies on Tuesday. Promoted up the order to open the batting alongside skipper Rohit Sharma for the first time during this tour of the Caribbean, Yadav has been a shining light for India and his 111 runs at a strike rate in excess of 168 through the first three matches of the series has helped the Asian country claim a 2-1 series lead. It's also boosted Yadav's chances of making the trip to Australia for the ICC T20 World Cup later this year and if he can overtake Babar and claim the No.1 T20I ranking then his case will almost be insurmountable. And Yadav is likely to get the chance to overtake Babar at the head of proceedings over the coming week, with India still having two more games against West Indies remaining in their five-match series. Should Yadav score well in those matches then he may usurp Babar as the No.1 ranked batter, given Pakistan's next T20I contest is at the end of the month against India at the Asia Cup. Pakistan veteran Mohammad Rizwan (third), South Africa's Aiden Markram (fourth) and England left-hander Dawid Malan (fifth) all dropped a place due to Yadav's jump, while there were a host of other batters that made giant strides on the latest rankings update. South Africa opener Reeza Hendricks jumped 16 places to 15th overall, while team-mate Tristan Stubbs rose a whopping 1,404 spots to equal 126th overall. Gustav McKeon also caught the eye following his heroics at the T20 World Cup 2024 Europe Sub-Regional Qualifiers, with the French opener improving 706 spots to joint 134th. South Africa spinner Tabraiz Shamsi jumped one place to second overall on the latest T20I bowler rankings on the back of his strong showing during the Proteas' series against England, with Afghanistan superstar Rashid Khan dropping to third as a result. West Indies spinner Akeal Hosein rises three spots to sixth and a career-high rating following a solid start to the series against India, while there were a handful of notable improvers on the list for all-rounders. Markram rose four spots to equal seventh, while Zimbabwe star Sikandar Raza (up eight spots to 11th) and India hard-hitter Hardik Pandya (nine place rise to 13th) also caught the eye. It was a quiet week near the top of proceedings in both the Test and ODI rankings, with a small number of players swapping positions on the latest update in both formats. India skipper Rohit Sharma dropped a spot to ninth on the Test batter rankings, while team-mate Jasprit Bumrah rose a place to equal third on the list for bowlers. Sri Lanka spinners Ramesh Mendis (up 19 spots to 31st) and Prabath Jayasuriya (up 11 places to 33rd) made ground on the Test rankings for bowlers, while team-mate Dinesh Chandimal improved two spots to 16th on the Test batter rankings. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Babar Azam closes in on rankings trilogy | The Daily Star","""Babar Azam is one step closer in his quest of becoming the No.1 batter in all three formats of the game after the Pakistan captain inched closer to the top Test ranking on the latest MRF Tyres ICC Men's Player Rankings. While the Pakistan skipper already holds top billing in both white-ball formats, the 27-year-old is yet to reach the summit at Test level and still trails England's Joe Root following the latest rankings update released by the ICC on Wednesday. Root remains clear at the top of the Test list, but Babar rises one spot to third overall and to a career high rating of 874 points on the back of his tremendous century in the opening Test of Pakistan's ongoing series against Sri Lanka in Galle. Babar scored almost 55 percent of Pakistan's first-innings runs during that Test, with the right-hander contributing 119 runs to a team score of 218 that ultimately helped the side keep in touch with Sri Lanka's first innings total of 222. Babar recently said it was a dream of his to become the No.1 ranked batter in all three formats of the game and this rankings rise sees him move that little bit closer to achieving that very difficult goal. The in-form captain wasn't the only Pakistan player to make an eye-catching move on the latest rankings, with star pacer Shaheen Afridi also jumping up a spot on the list for for Test bowlers. Afridi picked up four wickets during the first innings of that Test against Sri Lanka and that catapulted him in front of India quick Jasprit Bumrah and into third on the bowler rankings.

Only two batters have had more points after six Tests – Sunil Gavaskar (692) and Donald Bradman (687). Shafique's 671 points are the most for a Pakistan batter after six Tests, the previous being Saeed Ahmed with 614 points. Sri Lanka right-hander Dinesh Chandimal rises 11 places to 18th following scores of 76 and 94*. Prabath Jayasuriya has climbed 11 spots to the 44th position with 481 points, the fourth-highest by any bowler after two Tests, after Narendra Hirwani (519), Alec Bedser (500) and Bob Massie (494). There was no movement inside the top 10 on the latest T20I rankings following the completion of New Zealand's series in Ireland, but there were some changes on the updated ODI lists. The ODI series between England and South Africa finished squared at 1-1 and it was in-form Proteas star Quinton de Kock that benefitted most as he jumped two places on the latest batter rankings. MEN'S ODI BATTING RANKINGS De Kock hit an unbeaten 92 during the final match of the series in Leeds and that saw the 29-year-old left-hander rise two places to fourth overall. Babar still holds a commanding lead at the head of proceedings, while India duo Virat Kohli (fifth) and Rohit Sharma (sixth) each drop a spot courtesy of de Kock's noticeable move.

"‘There is none even close to IPL’ | The Daily Star","""The Indian Premier League's (IPL) stature as the world's top Twenty20 competition is secure despite the emergence of similar franchise-based tournaments around the world, its chairman Arun Singh Dhumal told Reuters. The IPL, with an estimated brand value of $8.4 billion, continues to attract the world's top players and coaches with the kind of money T20 competitions in Australia and England can only dream of. The landscape is changing, however, with lucrative leagues starting up in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa this year, while Major League Cricket gets underway in the United States next month. Even if players now have more choice where to take their talent than ever before, Dhumal was confident the IPL would retain its primacy in franchise cricket. """"We don't see anyone else as our competition, there is none even close to IPL,"""" he told Reuters by telephone. """"Our best wishes to all the boards starting their own T20 leagues, but I don't think any of them can be a threat to IPL."""" Dhumal's conviction stems from the strong viewership numbers for this year's IPL, which concluded on Monday, especially from the league's digital partner. Jio Cinema, in a statement on Wednesday, said more than 120 million unique viewers had tuned in to watch Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans in a dramatic final, with a peak concurrency of 32.1 million. """"It has been a phenomenal success, and largely because of the sheer competitiveness of this year's tournament,"""" Dhumal added. """"Most of the matches went down to the wire and there were plenty of last-over thrillers. We got a phenomenal response from the fans. Our viewership grew manifold and our broadcast and digital partners both are excited. """"Even the in-stadia experience of the fans has been phenomenal, and going forward it's only going to get better."""" The IPL's popularity has remained undimmed since its 2008 inception and the Indian cricket board's (BCCI) policy of not allowing its own players to participate in foreign leagues has helped ensure its preeminence. Dhumal said the IPL would remain a 10-team event but the number of matches, currently 74 per season, might go up to 94 if it gets a bigger window in the calendar prepared by the governing International Cricket Council (ICC). While the IPL offers life-changing money for most of its participants, the global cricketers' association has called for players to receive a bigger share of the league's revenue. Dhumal, however, said there had been no discussions about increasing the $11.5 million salary cap for each franchise. """"We will have to consult the franchises and team owners before taking a call,"""" he said. """"While we still have 10 months before the next IPL, a lot of discussion will have to take place before anything like that happens."""" Dhumal, who is also a senior BCCI official, also dismissed media reports that the IPL was planning to stage matches in Saudi Arabia or to help the oil-rich country set up its own T20 league.

The board is worried that the absence of a watch-dog at these hugely popular leagues could lead to match-fixing, which could dent its image further. In order to avoid such a scenario, BCCI is seriously looking at introducing a 'mini IPL' - a new T20 league run by the board along the lines of Cricket Australia's Big Bash. This league, meant solely for the Indian players, would give the domestic cricketers an ideal platform to showcase their talent and be picked up by Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises. The board wants to have this league in the 'window' reserved for CLT20 (which has now been scrapped) in September. It could also be launched as a 'revamped version' of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy, thus giving the domestic tournament a new meaning and look. According to sources, the proposal was floated by BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur in the working committee meeting on Sunday, and was """"well-received by other members"""". The idea will now be discussed in the AGM of the board here on November 9. It means that the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) will have no window for its hugely-successful Karnataka Premier League (KPL), which it has staged since 2009. Even the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) would be forced to rethink its plan for its soon-to-be-launched Mumbai T20. However, the other associations, who don't host any such league, will lap up the idea as it would give more exposure to their players besides bringing more revenue to them without having to undergo organisational hazards. The BCCI's proposed new league would be supervised by its anti-corruption and security unit (ACSU) officers. """"We discussed various possibilities about doing something with the vacant CLT20 window. Launching a 'mini IPL' was one of them. We will look into this possibility seriously. One of the proposals is about starting a league overseas,"""" IPL Chairman Rajiv Shukla told TOI. If this league turns out to be a relaunched version of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy, it could see zonal teams pitted against each other, just like the Deodhar and Duleep Trophy, with each side bearing a fancy name. Apart from teams from the five zones, this T20 event could also see a Board President's side, comprising largely of youngsters.

However the 24-year-old Afghan bowler has had to deal with pro-Kohli chants wherever he has played in India. Kohli made an undefeated 55 on Wednesday while Naveen finished with figures of 0-31 off his five overs. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Mavi stars on debut as India edge Sri Lanka in T20 thriller | The Daily Star","""Debutant fast bowler Shivam Mavi led an inspired bowling with his four wickets as India edged out Sri Lanka by two runs in a thrilling opening Twenty20 international on Tuesday. Mavi returned figures of 4-22 to help the hosts bowl out Sri Lanka for 160 in a victory target of 163 and lead the three-match series 1-0 in Mumbai. The 24-year-old Mavi was ably supported by fellow pace bowlers Umran Malik and Harshal Patel as they picked up two wickets each. Axar Patel, a left-arm spinner, held his nerve in a tense last over when Sri Lanka needed 12 for a win and Chamika Karunaratne gave India a scare with his unbeaten 23. Deepak Hooda (41) and Axar (31) set up victory with an unbeaten 68-run sixth-wicket stand that steered India to 162-5 after being tested by the Sri Lankan bowlers. Ishan Kishan came out attacking as he hit Kasun Rajitha for a six and two fours in a 17-run opening over after the tourists invited India to bat. India raced to 26 in the first two overs but soon lost momentum after losing their top and middle-order before Hooda, who hit four sixes in his 23-ball knock, and the left-handed Axar took charge. Debutant Shubman Gill began with a boundary but soon fell lbw for seven to mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana. Sri Lanka hit back with disciplined bowling and Karunaratne sent back Suryakumar Yadav after the batsman mistimed one of his audacious scoop shots to be caught at short fine leg. India lost two more wickets and slipped to 77-4 when wrist spinner Wanindu Hasaranga got the left-handed Kishan out for 37. Left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka added more misery to the opposition batting as he got skipper Hardik Pandya caught behind for 29. In reply, Mavi struck in his first over of international cricket as he bowled Pathum Nissanka for one. He then sent back Dhananjaya de Silva for eight in his next to put India on top. Sri Lanka kept losing wickets with tearaway quick Umran getting Charith Asalanka out for 12 and Harshal struck twice to leave Sri Lanka on 68-5.

Kohli's third century in his last four matches and a 116 by opener Shubman Gill powered India to 390-5 in Thiruvananthapuram. Fast bowler Mohammed Siraj then returned impressive figures of 4-32 as India bowled out the tourists for 72 in 22 overs as India went past New Zealand's 290-run thrashing of Ireland in 2008. A 131-run second-wicket stand between Gill and Kohli stood out after India elected to bat first. Gill put on 95 runs for the opening wicket with skipper Rohit Sharma, who made 42, to set the tone for the team's batting domination. Rohit missed out on a fifty after he fell to Chamika Karunaratne but Gill kept up the attack with Kohli and raised his second ODI hundred, celebrating it with a fist bump. Gill smashed Jeffrey Vandersay for four fours in the over after the ton, but was soon bowled off a slower delivery from Kasun Rajitha. """"King Kohli"""" put on another century partnership with Shreyas Iyer, who hit 38, and went on to record the ton with his arms and bat raised to an applauding crowd. The ball before Kohli got his hundred saw a nasty collision at the square-leg boundary between Vandersay and Ashen Bandara, with both fielders stretchered off. Dunith Wellalage came in as a concussion substitute for Vandersay and batted for the tourists at number eight. Kohli changed gears after his 46th ODI century -- three behind Sachin Tendulkar's all-time record of 49 -- as he smashed Karunaratne for two successive sixes. Kohli, who surpassed Sri Lankan great Mahela Jayawardene's 12,650 ODI runs to enter the top five all-time run getters, reached his 150 in 106 balls and finished off with 13 fours and eight sixes. Sri Lanka were never in the chase after Mohammed Siraj struck thrice in his first five overs including the wickets of Avishka Fernando, for one, and Kusal Mendis, bowled on four. The tourists kept losing wickets to Siraj's pace and swing and the quick also ran out Karunaratne with a direct throw that caught the batsman off guard and out of his crease at the striker's end. Mohammed Shami and Kuldeep Yadav picked two wickets each to flatten Sri Lanka's batting with 28 overs to spare, with the tourists losing nine wickets and injured Bandara not batting. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Dimuth Karunaratne, on 11, and Lahiru Thirimanne, on 9, were at the crease after paceman Ishant Sharma bowled Sadeera Samarawickrama for 0 with the second ball of the innings. The day belonged to Kohli, who hit a majestic 213 before falling to off-spinner Dilruwan Perera. He walked off to a standing ovation from a raucous crowd. It was the star batsman's fifth 200-plus score in his 62nd Test. He has also achieved double centuries against the West Indies, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. Kohli and Rohit put on 173 for the fifth wicket to pulverise a deflated Sri Lanka attack that sent down 176.1 overs in about six sessions of play. Kohli, who started the day on 54, smashed 17 fours and two sixes during his 267-ball knock. He received able support from Sharma, who reached his 50 before tea and then stepped up a gear to amass runs all around the ground and register his third Test hundred. Kohli's 183-run third-wicket stand with his overnight partner Cheteshwar Pujara had taken the steam out of the attack. Pujara was bowled by paceman Dasun Shanaka for 143 in the first session, but Kohli kept scoring quickly in his team's bid to bat just once in the match.

Suryakumar smashed four sixes during a brilliant knock of 83 in the third-match of the T20I series against the West Indies and in the process became just the third men's player from India behind star duo Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to have hit a century of sixes in the shortest format of the game. No one in the world has hit more sixes than Rohit's 182, with Kohli (117) and Suryakumar (101) chasing their experienced captain and among a group of 14 men's players in international cricket to have gone past the magical three figure milestone. Suryakumar was at his magnificent best against the West Indies as he combined well with young gun Tilak Varma (49*) to ensure India successfully chased down the West Indies' modest score of 159/5 for the loss of just three wickets and with more than two overs remaining. India's victory means the five-match series is now well poised with the West Indies leading 2-1 and the remaining two games scheduled to take place in Florida on Saturday and Sunday. Spin duo Kuldeep Yadav (3/28) and Axar Patel (1/24) put the clamps on the West Indies to reduce the hosts to a meagre total after they had won the toss and elected to bat. Suryakumar wasn't fazed by the early loss of openers Shubman Gill (6) and Yashavi Jaiswal (1) as he terrorised the opposition bowlers with the clean hitting that he has become famous for in recent times. A total of 64 of Suryakumar's 83 runs came through boundaries and, by the time he was out in the 13th over, India was in a dominant position to cruise home under the watchful eyes of skipper Hardik Pandya (20*) and Varma. While Varma fell agonisingly short of a second consecutive half-century in just his third international appearance, Suryakumar was suitably impressed with the left-hander's maturity and believes the 20-year-old has a bright future in the game. """"I feel for his age, he's showing amazing maturity,"""" Suryakumar said of Varma said post-match.

"Shakib emphasises on teamwork to end on a high | The Daily Star","""Bangladesh's Asia Cup hopes have already been dashed but with a host of starters unavailable, the Tigers will be keen on trying some new combinations to finish their campaign on a high against India in Colombo today. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan, however, seemed quite uninterested in entertaining the eager questions from the media when he attended Thursday's pre-match presser. In fact, he did not seem very eager to answer anything in particular. Usually, Shakib is someone who addresses issues in a rather diplomatic way, barring the times he feels the need to be direct. In a very nonchalant manner, Shakib said that it is not only up to him to shoulder all the responsibility when asked what his message to the side was ahead of today's contest as the most experienced campaigner.

As Shakib mentioned, his only motive is now to win against India. He also brushed aside suggestions that he will not feature in the coming series against New Zealand. Shakib was also in no mood to divulge what areas of the team he was satisfied with or not satisfied with. """"Actually, what areas I am satisfied with and what areas I am not satisfied with are not things to be discussed in the media.

The skipper also mentioned that he was not quite sure whether Asia Cup performances would affect the side going forward. However, it is not true that all the batters struggled in the continental championship. Najmul Hossain Shanto is still the third-highest run-scorer in the tournament even after being ruled out of the Asia Cup just after two games due to injury. Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Tawhid Hridoy have found runs as well. But not everyone has found their feet in important moments. Shakib himself has struck just one fifty in the tournament. He got dismissed playing similar shots against Sri Lanka in both matches. Against Afghanistan, his cameo was useful in putting up a big score -- the only instance when collective performance was seen from the Tigers in the Asia Cup. Against Pakistan, he had looked good but perhaps picked the wrong moment to up the ante and lost his wicket. Had he made a bigger score, Bangladesh could have been in a better position in that game. Without the in-form Shanto, the onus was very much on veterans Shakib and Mushfiqur Rahim but they failed to make the the kind of contributions that would have given the team more vitality in crucial match scenarios. Also, Shamim Hossain and Afif Hossain continuing to disappoint at the lower middle order did not help the Tigers during crunch moments. Amid all his snarky replies yesterday, Shakib, however, did leave a message for the team. """"I think [Abdur Razzak] Raz bhai said one good thing that day which is that those who are playing in the national team are doing so because they are capable.

Shanto, who came in at four on the day, was one of the batters to blame as Bangladesh's first four batters were back in the hut for 56 within the 13th over of the first innings. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan and veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim tried to put a band-aid on the already dented batting effort with a 96-run stand but it wasn't enough to pull the Tigers out of their batting rut that produced yet another sorry display, managing just 245 for nine on a good surface. """"We didn't bat well, same as the last match. We need to improve in the first 15 overs. There was a bit of extra bounce with the new ball but after that the wicket was quiet. The top order needs to bat more responsibly. It was a good wicket, so we just needed to be a bit more responsible at the start,"""" Shanto said in the post-match interview. """"In the last match, we didn't bowl well but today everyone showed their character. If they continue like this it will be very good going forward. The biggest improvement is our fast bowling, if we bat well in the next few games it will be a different ball game,"""" he added. The top-order tumble started with Liton Das's baffling approach that saw him charge Trent Boult on the very first delivery of the innings. The right-handed batter, who scored a fifty in his previous match, clipped it straight to deep fine-leg to continue his hit-or-miss performance at the top. His partner Tanzid Tamim followed soon. He chipped a full-length ball off his legs straight to Lockie Ferguson at square leg. What should've been a bread-and-butter shot for any top-order player made its way into the hands of the only fielder guarding that side of the ground. Next up was Mehedi Hasan Miraz, who looked impressive and at ease for his 46-ball 30 before he went out of character and tried to hook Ferguson over deep fine-leg. Not the most natural of pullers nor hookers, Miraz went for the shot against a Ferguson, who was spearing it through at an excess of 140 km/p, anyways and that too towards the longer part of the ground. In-form Shanto couldn't help either, perishing when he scooped one to short extra cover on the very first delivery that off-spinner Glenn Phillips had bowled. This similar scenario managed to pull down Bangladesh's chance at a fighting total, a case that the Tigers are quite familiar with. Bangladesh were bundled out for 227 while chasing 364 for nine in their previous match against England in Dharamshala.

Poland brought the energy early and Jakub Blaszczykowski, making his 109th and final Poland appearance, had a shot blocked by Thiaw on the counter after 13 minutes. Blaszczykowski was substituted soon after, the 37-year-old receiving a standing ovation from both sets of fans, after more than a decade playing in Germany for Borussia Dortmund and Wolfsburg. The hosts continued the celebratory mood, taking the lead midway through the first half when Kiwor shed West Ham defender Thilo Kehrer to head in a Piotr Zielinksi corner. Germany upped the ante in the second half and looked to have a golden chance to equalise 10 minutes in when Jan Bednarek was ruled to have handled in the box. Poland were however granted a reprieve when the spot-kick was overturned on review, with VAR replays showing insufficient contact with the Southampton centre-back's arm. Kimmich, who saved Germany's blushes from the spot in injury time against Ukraine, tried from distance but his shot rattled off the crossbar. Flick made five attacking changes in the closing minutes but Germany were unable to find the goal.

"Guardiola delighted with Alvarez’s huge impact | The Daily Star","""Holders Manchester City struck twice in the final minutes through Julian Alvarez and Jeremy Doku to beat hosts RB Leipzig 3-1 on Wednesday and rebound from successive domestic defeats to take control of Champions League Group G with maximum points. Alvarez curled his shot from the edge of the box into the top corner in the 84th minute and then set up Doku in stoppage time for their third goal as City, who had lost to Newcastle United in the EFL Cup before their league loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, moved up to six points from two games in top spot. Coach Pep Guardiola hailed the huge impact from Julian Alvarez. The City boss said he has no doubts about his quality after playing his part in last season's treble as well as helping Argentina to the World Cup in a remarkable individual season. But with the good form of John Stones, Rodrigo, Kevin De Bruyne and former captain Ilkay Gundogan in midfield last season, Alvarez has been patient for his opportunity. And he has been in outstanding form this season with five goals and four assists already and made a big contribution as a 79th minute substitute in Germany. """"When a player is a world champion with Argentina and plays in the starting XI for Argentina, it's because he is a good player,"""" Guardiola said. """"Last season he arrived in a moment when we had John, Rodri, Kevin, Gundo and it was working well and he didn't get many minutes but he never complained and look what happened now.

"City's Laporte joins Al-Nassr | The Daily Star","""Aymeric Laporte joined the Premier League exodus to Saudi Arabia on Thursday as the Manchester City defender moved to Al-Nassr in a deal worth a reported £23 million ($29 million). Spain centre-back Laporte won 12 major honours during his successful spell with City. However, he fell out of favour at times during City's treble-winning campaign and the close-season signing of Croatia defender Josko Gvardiol further restricted his chances of regular action. The 29-year-old is the latest City star to accept a lucrative switch to the Gulf State after Algeria winger Riyad Mahrez recently joined Al-Ahli. Laporte made 180 appearances for City after arriving from Athletic Bilbao for a then club record £57 million in January 2018. """"I am proud to have represented Manchester City over the last six seasons,"""" Laporte said. """"When I first joined, I was excited about the prospect of winning trophies. However, I could not have imagined the success we would go on to achieve together. """"I would like to thank the coaches, my team-mates and of course the brilliant City fans for all of their support throughout my time in Manchester. """"I will always be a City fan and I look forward to seeing you all again."""" Laporte won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and five domestic cups as a member of Pep Guardiola's squad.

"Saudi Arabia set to profit from Ronaldo move, says football finance expert | The Daily Star","""Cristiano Ronaldo's move to Al Nassr could lead to a financial windfall for his new club and Saudi Arabia, football finance expert Neil Joyce told Reuters, as the Portugal international gears up for his first game in the country since the deal was announced. Ronaldo was named captain of Riyadh ST XI -- a team made up of Al Nassr and Al Hilal players -- for an exhibition match on Thursday against Lionel Messi's Paris St Germain. The 37-year-old forward's contract with Al Nassr is estimated by the media to be worth more than 200 million euros ($215.76 million) and the deal has drawn a huge amount of attention which is likely to offer monetary opportunities, Joyce said. """"It's well-publicised the growth of the Al Nassr fanbase after Ronaldo joined, they went from under a million fans to like eight million in a space of like 10 days,"""" said Joyce, who is CEO & co-founder of CLV Group and advises clubs on how best to maximise their revenues through engagement with their global fanbases. """"There are monetary opportunities for them. For sponsorship, suddenly showing the global brands that you can reach eight million fans, there's some monetization that they could benefit from straight away on it. """"He's got a heavy following around celebrities, TV, entertainment and pop music, so, there are content opportunities for Saudi Arabia to almost be a hub for TV and entertainment. Also to promote the country as a destination."""" According to Joyce, Ronaldo's move to Saudi Arabia would also set a precedent for more big-name players to arrive and develop the Saudi league in the same way to Pele's impact on US Soccer after he joined New York Cosmos in 1975. """"It's more of a short-term hit that they can get with him. But also, if they want to become the next version of the MLS (Major League Soccer). Think back to Pele,"""" Joyce added. """"The Ronaldo effect could take hold in that area and, given the success of the World Cup in that region, I think it makes a lot of sense for Ronaldo and the value that it can bring in the not-too-distant future.

"Ronaldo's Man Utd return 'turned out wrong': Solskjaer | The Daily Star","""Former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has admitted the club's re-signing of Cristiano Ronaldo """"turned out wrong"""". Solskjaer was in charge when United brought the five-time Ballon d'Or winner back to Old Trafford in a much-hyped move in August 2021. At the time the transfer was viewed as a coup that could potentially fuel a Premier League title challenge for the Red Devils, who had finished second the previous season. But things soon unravelled as the team struggled and Solskjaer was sacked in November that year. Ronaldo left the club in acrimonious fashion 12 months later and currently plays his football in the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr. """"It was about taking the next step to challenge for the title.

"Ronaldo's Al Nassr leave it late to snatch Asian Champions League spot | The Daily Star","""Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr qualified for the Asian Champions League group stage after they secured an injury-time victory against Shabab Al Ahli in Riyadh on Tuesday. The Saudi Pro League side came from behind to triumph 4-2 in the play-off at Mrsool Park, with Brazilian Anderson Talisca scoring twice and Croatia international Marcelo Brozovic rounding off the win. Nassr had been two minutes from exiting the tournament. The result means Nassr, runners-up domestically last season, move into the group phase, which begins next month. Ronaldo, a five-time UEFA Champions League winner, was making his debut in Asian football's top club competition after signing for the Riyadh club last December. Nassr opened the scoring on 11 minutes, when Taslica headed home a Brozovic corner. However, Yahya Al Ghassani levelled for UAE champions Shabab Al Ahli seven minutes later, the winger slotting the ball into the Nassr net after the Dubai side countered. Ronaldo, 38, left the pitch at half-time clearly frustrated and could been seen arguing with the referee. The Portuguese star, the Nassr captain, believed he should have had two penalties in the first half. Then, one minute after half-time, Al Ghassani raced clear of the Nassr defence to flick the ball over Nawaf Al Aqidi and put Shabab Al Ahli in front. However, Nassr equalised with two minutes of normal time remaining, when full-back Sultan Al Ghannam's header was diverted into his own goal by Walid Abbas. Nassr's comeback was complete five minutes into the allotted seven minutes of injury time, with Talisca nodding home from close range. Moments later, as Shabab Al Ahli chased the equaliser, Ronaldo teed up Brozovic to drill his shot into the net and make safe the game.

"Argentina maintain winning start | The Daily Star","""World champions Argentina made it three wins out of three in South American World Cup qualifying with a hard-earned 1-0 win over a determined Paraguay on Thursday. A third-minute goal from Nicolas Otamendi was just enough for Lionel Scaloni's team, with Lionel Messi coming off in the bench in the second half and hitting the woodwork twice. Darwin Nunez struck a stoppage time penalty as Uruguay fought back for a 2-2 draw with Colombia in Barranquilla while Ecuador got their first points with a last gasp 2-1 win at Bolivia. Messi's fight for full fitness inevitably dominated the build-up to Argentina's attempt to maintain their 100% record and the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner started on the bench with Julian Alvarez and Lautaro Martinez leading the attack. But it was veteran defender Otamandi who provided the moment of attacking inspiration, meeting a Rodrigo De Paul corner with a brilliant volley at the back post. Atletico Madrid midfielder De Paul went close to doubling the lead three minutes before the break when he struck the post and moments later Nicolas Gonzalez fired just wide. Messi replaced Alvarez in the 53rd minute as Scaloni looked to break down a disciplined and well organised Paraguay side but the woodwork foiled their talisman. An inswinging corner from the right almost snuck in, but struck the post and then, after winning a free kick on the edge of the box, Messi curled his shot against the same post. Colombia paid the price for squandering a series of chances to put the game to bed after taking a 2-1 lead in the 52nd minute through Mateus Uribe. James Rodriguez put Colombia ahead in the 35th minute, bringing down a cross from Santiago Arias with his right foot and then drilling home with his left. Uruguay drew level just a minute after the restart when Mathias Olivera was left unattended to head home a Nicolas de la Cruz corner. But Colombia restored their lead when Luis Diaz burst inside from the left flank and fed Rafael Borre, whose low cross was tucked home by Uribe. Luis Diaz then missed a glorious chance for a third when he was sent through, one on one, with the goalkeeper but scooped his shot high over the bar. Rodriguez saw a low shot from inside the box strike the post and a minute later fed Jhon Arias, who clipped his shot against the bar. Uruguay escaped with a point after Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas rushed off his line and collided with Maximiliano Araujo. Vargas was dismissed for a second yellow card and Liverpool striker Nunez kept his cool to bury the penalty and give Marcelo Bielsa's side a precious point. Kendry Paez, the 16-year-old Ecuadorean prodigy, became the youngest player to score in a CONMEBOL World Cup qualifier when he put his team ahead against Bolivia in La Paz with a composed finish in the 45th minute. A great shot on the turn from Rodrigo Ramallo levelled for Bolivia before a defensive lapse allowed Kevin Rodriguez to grab the winner for Ecuador in the sixth minute of stoppage time to leave Bolivia still without a point. Brazil, having won their opening pair of games, hope to continue their positive start against Venezeula later on Thursday while Chile host Peru. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Miami, who won the Leagues Cup on penalties against Nashville on Saturday, are now one win away from their second trophy since Messi joined the club last month. Cincinnati are top of Major League Soccer's standings while Miami are bottom but the Florida team are now a very different side to the one which was winless in their 11 league games before the arrival of the Argentine. The enthralling unbeaten run of Miami, since the signing of Messi and Spanish pair Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, looked to be coming to an end in Ohio against an impressive Cincinnati side. Inter trailed 2-0 with 22 minutes remaining before the Argentine delivered two perfect assists to striker Leonardo Campana to take the game into extra-time. Messi's compatriot Luciano Acosta put Cincinnati ahead in the 18th minute and American striker Brandon Vazquez doubled the home side's lead with a fine strike from the edge of the box in the 53rd minute.  But in the 68th minute, Messi whipped in a free-kick from the left which was headed home by Campana to breathe some life into what had been a tired display from Gerardo Martino's side. Then in the seventh minute of stoppage time Messi, from deep on the left, swung in a ball to Campana at the back post again and the Ecuadoran forward angled home his header to force extra-time. Miami went ahead in the first period with Benjamin Cremaschi sliding an excellent pass into the path of Josef Martinez and the Venezuelan made no mistake with a clinical finish. But Cincinnati bounced back in the second period with Japanese winger Yuya Kubo firing a right-foot shot into the far corner past the diving Drake Callender. The teams were at 4-4 in the shoot-out when Callender saved Nick Hagglund's penalty for Cincinnati and Cremaschi converted to book Miami's place in the final.

Moments after his free kick was blocked by New York's five-man wall, Messi moved the ball by five New York defenders to Benjamin Cremaschi. Messi then moved to the center of the net, waited for Cremaschi's return feed and scored into an open net as New York goalkeeper Carlos Coronel was well out of position to stop the 36-year-old star. It was Messi's 11th goal in all competitions since joining Miami (6-14-3, 21 points) July 15 and sealed the club's first win since May 13. Before Messi sealed the win, Miami had been 0-8-3 in its previous 11 MLS matches. Messi did not warm up but fans began chanting for him in the opening minutes and again in the 35th -- right before Diego Gomez scored his first MLS goal in his MLS debut after signing with Miami five days after Messi. In the 37th after New York could not properly clear following a Miami set piece, Noah Allen gained possession and connected a streaking Gomez who blasted a left-footed shot from the middle of the box into the bottom right corner past Coronel's right hand. Messi entered in the 60th minute for Leonardo Campana, who moments before the star's big entrance missed the net. Miami goalkeeper Drake Callender made four saves for his fourth clean sheet of the season and seventh of his career. He made a diving stop on Tom Barlow in the 57th and a leaping stop with his right hand on Omir Fernandez's header in the 50th.

Messi scored one of his trademark wonder goals, to put Miami 1-0 up in the Leagues Cup final at Nashville on Saturday but the Tennessee side fought back for a 1-1 draw, forcing penalties where Miami emerged victors for their first title in their three year history. """"Very happy to get the first title in this club's history. Everyone's hard work and commitment made it possible. Hopefully this is just the beginning,"""" Messi posted on Instagram. The Argentine World Cup winner has scored 10 goals in his seven games so far, finding the net in each match, and he left club owner Jorge Mas beaming in delight as his audacious move to bring in the game's top player delivered its first title. """"To see Lionel with that smile, all the guys how they are playing. This will be the first of many trophies for this team,"""" he told reporters. David Beckham, who created the club before bringing in Mas as the key investor, reflected on the years he spent trying to make the team a reality but even he appeared taken back by how quickly the team has gone from strugglers in MLS to a team being watched around the world. """"A lot can happen in five weeks, a lot has changed for us,"""" he said. """"We will enjoy this but now we have to look to the future and continue to build because we have some of the best players in the world out their on the field wearing pink but also, more importantly we had a bunch of academy players out there with them and that is important for us as a club and indeed for the country,"""" he added. The jubilant players interrupted the press conference of victorious coach Gerardo Martino, spraying him with champagne, but they will have to sober up quickly because their next challenge comes in Ohio on Wednesday when they face FC Cincinnati in the semi-final of the US Open Cup. Then Miami return to the main business of the Major League Soccer regular season, where the team will be looking to climb from bottom of the Eastern Conference into the playoff places to give themselves a chance of another trophy – with 12 games to go they have little room for error. As the players chanted in the locker-room at the end of an entertaining, unbeaten seven games in Leagues Cup, Martino's thoughts were turning to the next test. """"There's not a long time to celebrate. On Wednesday we have another game and we will continue playing and competing like this in the different tournaments,"""" said Martino. """"This one is in the past. And now we are thinking about the match against Cincinnati."""" Former Barcelona and Argentine coach Martino said the intense format of the month-long tournament had helped Miami gel together as a team after the arrival of Messi and Spanish pair Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. Growing and dreaming """"I remember the first days and I felt we needed to do more training sessions to give shape to the team and I was thinking, how convenient it is to have this tournament, because we can take advantage of this month to play more,"""" he said. """"And after this month, we are champions, so it feels great, and it helps us continue growing, keep dreaming. I think we clearly understand now what we can do looking forward. We better understand the future, and it's more clear,"""" he said. The Leagues Cup just concluded its first year as a competition bringing all top flight teams from Mexico and Major League Soccer together for a mid-season, World Cup-style tournament. MLS Commissioner Don Garber said that the tournament had been a huge success with Messi's impact lifting it to unimagined heights. Garber said the Argentine's arrival """"accelerated the popularity and interest in the tournament. Our television ratings have been spectacular. Our Apple TV ratings have been, for us, dramatically more than we expected,"""" he said. Messi's presence and Miami's run to the title had been """"the talk of the football world,"""" said Garber. DeAndre Yedlin, Miami's captain before handing over to Messi on his arrival, said the team had undergone a total change. """"We walk in to places now, we expect to win. I can't say that was a factor every time we played before,"""" he said. """"It is our seventh game together as a group. It is strange, we are still kind of learning on the go,"""" he said before he too focused on the next step. """"Now we have a semi-final.

"Messi scores two more as Miami march past Orlando | The Daily Star","""Lionel Messi made it five goals in three appearances for Inter Miami as he scored twice in a 3-1 win over Orlando City in the Leagues Cup round-of-32 on Wednesday. Messi scored twice from close range to maintain his 100 percent winning record with Miami, who were winless in 11 league games before his arrival. Messi will now head on the road with Miami for the first time with Sunday's match with FC Dallas in Texas offering a place in the quarter-finals of the tournament for top flight teams from Major League Soccer and Mexico's Liga MX. Wednesday's Florida derby was not a game which will be featured in the Messi highlight videos but despite being frustrated by tight-marking for most of the game, the seven-time Ballon D'Or winner emerged the decisive figure once again. A thunderstorm led to a 95-minute delay to the kick-off but when the game began, Miami picked up where they left off in their 4-0 win over Atlanta United last week - attacking with intent. Robert Taylor, the Finnish winger, cut in from the left and chipped a perfect ball into the path of the on-running Messi who brought the ball down with his chest and volleyed home from six yards out. But Orlando responded strongly and they drew level ten minutes later when a low shot from Ivan Angulo was pushed out by Miami keeper Drake Callender and Uruguayan Cesar Araujo pounced on the edge of the box to drive a low shot into the corner. Frustration Orlando were increasingly effective in closing down Messi and the Argentine showed the first signs of frustration when he picked up a yellow card for a foul on Wilder Cartagena. Orlando coach Oscar Pareja had clearly given his team instructions to sacrifice possession to Miami to ensure they had enough players to crowd out and neutralise Messi and Busquets, and the approach was working. Openings were limited for Messi and when he did get some space near the goal in the 32nd minute, after good work from DeAndre Yedlin, he squeezed his left-foot shot wide. The Argentine had an opportunity with a free-kick from within his range, just before the break but his effort from over 25 yards out was comfortably tipped over by keeper Pedro Gallese. Messi looked unhappy as he left the field at the break, perhaps by the physical nature of some of the marking he had received as much as the lack of space he had found in the game. But Miami found a way to restore their lead without the involvement of their star man -- 18-year-old Benjamin Cremaschi slipped a pass into the box to Martinez who feeling a slight tug from Antonio Carlos went down and won a penalty. Orlando were unhappy with the decision but their protests were to no avail and Martinez, after a stutter and a shuffle, fired home. Miami made sure of the win and progression to the last 16 when Taylor broke down the left and picked out Martinez at the back of the box who chested the ball and found Messi with a clever chip which the Argentine gleefully tucked away. Another former Barcelona star Jordi Alba made his debut for Miami, coming on as a 64th minute substitute and although Araujo had an effort disallowed in stoppage time, there was little trouble in the latter stages for Messi's team. Miami's right-back DeAndre Yedlin suggested that Orlando's approach had come from fear while Miami continued to play with belief. """"He just gives everyone around him confidence. You can give him balls in difficult situations and know he's going to make something out of it. """"The flipside is that for the teams we're playing against, it puts a bit of fear in their eyes. They're dropping back on their heels a bit and that gives us more space to play,"""" he said. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

""""I remember that when I arrived in Barcelona they immediately asked me who the best player in the world was. I had to say it was Lionel Messi, I lied. It was one of the biggest lies of my life,"""" he told the podcast. """"Normally I always tell the truth, but I lied because it was the only way to wear the Barcelona shirt.

"Ronaldo's Al Nassr draw with Inter in Osaka friendly | The Daily Star","""Cristiano Ronaldo was replaced at half-time as Al Nassr drew 1-1 with Champions League finalists Inter Milan in the second game of their pre-season tour in Japan on Thursday. Abdulrahman Ghareeb opened the scoring for Al Nassr midway through the first half, before Davide Frattesi equalised for Inter a minute before half-time Portugal superstar Ronaldo joined Al Nassr from Manchester United in January, a moment that brought Saudi football to world attention. Since then, the Public Investment Fund -- one of the world's richest sovereign wealth funds -- has continued to recruit players for Saudi clubs from Europe's biggest leagues, including France striker Karim Benzema who joined Al Ittihad from Real Madrid. Alex Telles followed in Ronaldo's footsteps by signing for Al Nassr from United on Sunday, making his first start in Osaka. The Brazilian left-back created the first clear chance in the 20th minute, but compatriot Talisca's header was saved by Inter goalkeeper Filip Stankovic. Ronaldo then sent an ambitious effort from range wide two minutes later before Ghareeb struck in the 23rd minute, guiding home beautifully as the ball dropped to him from a chipped Talisca pass. Lautaro Martinez and Joaquin Correa both spurned opportunities to equalise for Inter, but Frattesi made no mistake with a header from a Denzel Dumfries cross in the 44th minute. Ronaldo was one of many to depart at the break, as both Al Nassr manager Luis Castro and his Inter counterpart Simone Inzaghi opted to make mass substitutions. Martinez went on to miss a couple of gilt-edged chances in the second period but neither team could break the deadlock, leaving Al Nassr with their second draw of the week after a 0-0 against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.

"Ronaldo helps Al Nassr to historic Asia Cup win in Iran | The Daily Star","""Cristiano Ronaldo enjoyed a winning debut in the Asian Champions League as he helped Al Nassr to a 2-0 victory against 10-man Persepolis in Iran on Tuesday night. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner, who has five UEFA Champions League titles to his name, captained the Saudi Arabian side to an opening three points in Group E. The match at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran was played without fans after the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) upheld a one-game ban for Persepolis supporters dating back to 2021. That clearly helped Nassr, who grabbed both goals in the second half against the two-time runners-up, through a Danial Esmaeilifar own goal and a fine strike by defender Mohammed Qassem. It marked the first time a Saudi club played in Iran since 2016, after the AFC announced a """"ground-breaking agreement"""" earlier this month between the two countries' federations. Iran and Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties seven years ago, meaning Asian Champions League matches had been since played at neutral grounds. Ronaldo, 38, was heavily involved throughout, twice going close in the first half. His initial chance - a powerful, close-range header - was sent straight at Persepolis goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand which left Ronaldo beating the post in frustration. Nassr's hopes grew considerably at the beginning of the second half, when Persepolis midfielder Milad Sarlak was given a second yellow card, this time for appearing to stamp on Ronaldo's boot. Replays showed it was unintentional, the contact minimal. Ronaldo played a key role in Nassr's opener just after the hour, the Portuguese instigating the move that led to Abdulrahman Ghareeb's blocked shot cannoning off Persepolis full-back Esmaeilifar and nestling in the net. Ten minutes later, Nassr left-back Mohammed Qassem broke down the left and thumped his shot high past Beiranvand to double the visitors' advantage and secure the points. Incheon win In the group's other match, Iran's Istiklol were held to a goalless draw in Dushanbe by Qatari heavyweights Al Duhail. In Group A, 2003 winners Al Ain secured an impressive 3-0 victory at Pakhtakor in Tashkent, while Turkmenistan side Ahal defeated Saudi opponents Al Fayha 1-0 at home to record only a second win in the competition. In the East Asian side of the draw, South Korea's Incheon United opened their Group G account with a 4-2 win over J.League champions Yokohama F Marinos in Japan. As a result, Incheon sit on three points alongside Chinese Super League side Shandong Taishan, who were made to work for their 3-1 victory in Manila over Kaya-FC Iloilo of the Philippines. In Group I, South Korean champions, and 2020 Asian Champions League winners, Ulsan Hyundai won at home over Thailand's BG Pathum United 3-1, while Japan's Kawasaki Frontale saw off hosts Johor Darul Ta'zim 1-0 in Malaysia. The group stage, which this year returned to a home-and-away format for the first time since early 2020, runs until mid-December, with the 10 pool winners and the six best second-placed teams advancing to the knockout rounds.

"On This Day: Majestic Ronaldo scores hattrick against Spain in 2018 WC | The Daily Star","""Four years ago, Cristiano Ronaldo produced an emphatic performance as the forward bagged his maiden World Cup hattrick to help Portugal draw 3-3 against Spain in their Group B encounter of the FIFA World Cup 2018 in Sochi. With just two minutes left in the regulation time, Ronaldo swerved a sweetly-timed freekick past the Spanish wall and keeper David De Gea as Portugal roared to level terms. Ronaldo also made yet another record in that game as he became the first player to score in eight consecutive major international tournaments when he converted a fourth-minute penalty after drawing a faul from his then Real Madrid teammate Nacho Fernandez to put Portugal 1-0 ahead in the game. With that goal, the Portugal skipper extended an unprecedented streak of scoring at major tournaments. Since finding the net at Euro 2004, he has gone on to grab goals at three further European Championships and four successive World Cups. Thanks to the goal, Ronaldo also became the fourth player to score in four World Cups, following in the footsteps of Uwe Seeler, Pele and Miroslav Klose. Ronaldo scored once again just before half-time to give Portugal the lead after Diego Costa equalised it for Spain. Portugal conceded two goals in the second half and it looked like Portugal would go on to start their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat. Ronaldo, however, had other ideas as he curled in a late freekick to ensure a point for Portugal. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Portugal got off to a flying start when Ramos rose highest to meet Bruno Fernandes' cross in the eighth minute, heading the ball down and past Martin Dubravka in the Slovakia goal.

"Sterling sparkles as Pochettino earns first Chelsea win | The Daily Star","""Raheem Sterling sparkled with a brace and Nicolas Jackson bagged his first goal for the club as Chelsea swept aside Luton 3-0 to give Mauricio Pochettino his first Premier League win as Blues boss on Friday. Sterling extended his impressive start to the season with a dazzling display that featured a sublime opener followed by a well-taken second and then an assist for Jackson. The England forward's return to form is the first sign Pochettino is starting to revitalise a team that struggled so badly last season. Pochettino, who only took charge in July, has quickly brought the best out of Sterling after his career looked in danger of fizzling out following a lacklustre first season with Chelsea. """"Mindset-wise I came to Chelsea at a difficult period. The most important thing is I've had a look at myself and I want to get back to being obsessed with football, it's as simple as that,"""" Sterling said. """"Your head can be a bit blurry and sometimes you need that clear vision. My love for football is too much, for me at this age of 28, to fizzle out."""" Pochettino added: """"Raheem needs to feel the confidence and be free on the pitch. I am very pleased for him and he needs to keep going and contribute with goals and assists."""" Tipping Jackson as a future star after his maiden goal, Pochettino said: """"He is going to score goals, it is a matter of time and he can be one of the greatest strikers in the Premier League."""" After drawing 1-1 with Liverpool and then losing 3-1 at West Ham, Pochettino will hope Chelsea's first home win since March kick-starts his reign. But it is early days for the former Tottenham and Paris Saint Germain boss, who is fielding an overhauled team with a youthful look at present. Pochettino was without nine first teamers due to injury, with skipper Reece James and summer signings Christopher Nkunku and Romeo Lavia among the absentees.  'Only the beginning' Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo was solid in his first Chelsea start since his British record £115 million from Brighton. Caicedo had endured a nightmare debut against West Ham as he gave away a penalty and looked rusty after coming off the bench, but this was a more steady display. """"The trust and confidence this victory will provide we can use for the future. I saw in the last nine or 10 games Chelsea didn't win so that is why it was important today to win,"""" Pochettino said. """"It is only the beginning and we have to work a lot on the way we want to play but the commitment of the players is fantastic."""" While Chelsea have great expectations after spending over £350 million on new signings since the end of last seasons, promoted Luton's more modest ambition is somehow avoiding relegation. After 31 years outside the top-flight, this was the first of the glamour fixtures Luton dreamed of when they languished in non-league obscurity just nine years ago. Luton's status as the smallest club ever to play in the Premier League has made them firm favourites for relegation and they have already lost their opening two games. Sterling opened the scoring in eye-catching fashion in the 17th minute, cutting in from the right flank and slaloming past three bewildered Luton defenders before planting a fine low finish into the far corner. Against the run of play, Luton almost snatched a shock equaliser through Ryan Giles, who took Elijah Adebayo's pass and hit a deflected shot that drew a panicked save from Robert Sanchez. But Sterling ensured Chelsea's dominance would not go unrewarded as he bagged their killer second goal in the 68th minute. Malo Gusto provided the assist with a low cross that Sterling met with a clinical finish from eight yards. Sterling turned provider seven minutes later with a teasing cross that eluded Luton's defence before Senegal striker Jackson alertly poked home from close-range. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Pochettino positive about restoring Chelsea success | The Daily Star","""New Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino is confident the team will only get better as he beds in his ideas and hopes to deliver quickly, the Argentine said on Friday as the west London club presented him at a press conference. Chelsea appointed Pochettino at the end of May after finishing 12th in the Premier League following a chaotic campaign, during which Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter and Frank Lampard had spells in charge of the side. The 51-year-old Pochettino, who has signed a two-year contract with the option of a further year, started work on July 1 and will hope to change Chelsea's fortunes after their worst finish since 1994. """"My target is to win, my aim is to win,"""" the former Tottenham Hotspur and Paris St Germain coach told reporters at Stamford Bridge. """"Football is about today, yesterday. You cannot talk too much long term. We cannot tell people we need six months to create because it seems not good. We need to create the belief from the beginning.

""""For me, it is clear, it is most important to finish the squad, to have a very balanced squad. """"The plan was to reduce the number of players.

"Chelsea striker Lukaku set for Roma loan: reports | The Daily Star","""Chelsea have agreed to loan of Belgian international striker Romelu Lukaku to Serie A side Roma, Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Monday. According to the Italian sports daily, Roma will pay the London club 5.8 million euros ($6.2 million) and the player will receive an annual salary of 7.5 million euros. Gazzetta said Lukaku is due to arrive in Rome on Tuesday to undergo a medical. At Roma, the Belgian will be reunited with Jose Mourinho, who previously coached the striker at Chelsea and Manchester United. Lukaku returned to Chelsea in 2021 for 115 million euros from Inter Milan. He first joined Chelsea in 2011 and left for Everton in 2014 before moving on to Manchester United and Inter. Lukaku, 30, spent last season on loan in Italy, back at Inter, scoring 14 goals. Roma have already signed Iranian international Sardar Azmoun on loan from Bayer Leverkusen and the Paris Saint-Germain midfield pair of Leandro Paredes and Renato Sanches, the latter also on loan.

Roma are yet to make their official announcement but Serie A have confirmed that the deal is done on their list of completed transfers. Thousands of fans greeted Belgium striker Lukaku after he touched down at Ciampino airport just outside the Italian capital on Tuesday, his arrival a boost for Roma following a worrying start to the new Serie A season. Italian media report that Chelsea accepted Roma's offer of around six million euros ($6.5 million) to take outcast Lukaku for this season, giving the Italians the striker they have been looking for since Tammy Abraham damaged knee ligaments at the end of last season. Lukaku has agreed to take a pay cut from nearly 11 million euros to around 7.5 million euros in order to move to Roma, who are operating under a Financial Fair Play settlement agreement made with UEFA. Roma have collected one point from their first two matches and their inability to convert dominance into goals was fully on display during Saturday's 2-1 loss at Verona. Chelsea meanwhile have been trying to permanently offload Lukaku all summer in a bid to end a disastrous transfer which cost the Premier League club a 115 million euro purchase fee from Inter Milan and his whopping annual salary. But talks with Inter -- where he was loaned back to last season -- collapsed reportedly after the club discovered he had been secretly talking to their biggest rivals Juve and AC Milan.

""""First of all we have chosen a striker and we are really happy with our choice,"""" Ten Hag said of the Denmark international during a news conference on Friday. """"(Kane) is a great striker.

"Man Utd's CL return clouded by ownership uncertainty | The Daily Star","""Manchester United are back in the Champions League but a bright future under Erik ten Hag remains clouded by uncertainty over the ownership of the English giants. Ten Hag ensured a top-four finish in his first season in charge of the Red Devils on Thursday with a 4-1 demolition of Chelsea. The Dutchman has also ended United's six-year trophy drought by lifting the League Cup in February and the best could even be yet to come should Ten Hag's men upset Manchester City's charge towards the treble at Wembley on June 3. Ten Hag has performed a miraculous turnaround since getting off to the worst start of any United manager since 1921. Embarrassing defeats to Brighton and Brentford in his first two matches are now long forgotten. The former Ajax boss earned a reputation as a disciplinarian after making his players run 14 kilometres after the 4-0 humiliation at Brentford in August - the combined distance the Bees ran more than his players during the game. But Ten Hag's strict approach has paid dividends as he also won the club's backing in a standoff that saw Cristiano Ronaldo depart mid-season for Saudi Arabia. """"He's proved that he's got the seriousness, the confidence and the authority to be able to make big decisions,"""" said former United captain Gary Neville on Ten Hag's man-management. Yet, the United fanbase is torn between hope, at what their manager could achieve with the right backing, and helplessness as a drawn out process to sell the club threatens to drag well into the summer transfer window. 'Glazers out' Unpopular from the day they saddled the club with huge debts via a leveraged takeover in 2005, most supporters want rid of current owners, the Glazer family, as soon as possible. Every United goal on Thursday was followed by fevered chants of """"we want Glazers out."""" The Glazer siblings appeared set to cash out at a huge profit on the club their late father Malcolm Glazer purchased for £790 million ($980 million) 18 years ago when the sale process was kicked-off back in November. But their reported world record price tag of £6 billion for a sports club means there are few takers looking to take outright control of the club. British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe and Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani are the front runners should the Americans decide to sell their majority shareholding. Alternatively, private equity firms are in the market for a minority stake that could allow the Glazers to retain control and provide the funding for investment in the club's infrastructure, such as a redevelopment of Old Trafford. But the long wait for the Glazers to come to a decision after three rounds of bidding has already eaten into United's preparation time for next season. Even if a preferred bidder is announced in the coming days, a takeover is unlikely to be completed by the time United players return for pre-season in July. All the while, their rivals are able to forge ahead tying down targets in the transfer market. United have gone a decade without a Premier League title and Ten Hag knows he needs support if he is to become the first man since Alex Ferguson to make them champions of England again. """"Now we are far away,"""" he said on challenging Manchester City at the top end of the Premier League next season. """"We have a lot of work to do.

"Trossard strikes as Arsenal end Everton curse | The Daily Star","""Arsenal ended their six-year wait for a Premier League victory at Everton as Leandro Trossard fired the title-chasing Gunners to a 1-0 success on Sunday. Mikel Arteta's side had to work hard for their first win at Goodison Park since 2017, with Belgian forward Trossard settling a scrappy encounter midway through the second half. Arsenal were not at their fluent best but they earned their fourth win in five games this season by matching Everton's physical approach. Arteta has warned his players they would only end their Everton curse if they are willing to put their bodies on the line and they rose to that challenge. After leaving it late to beat Manchester United in their previous game before the international break, this was another tense affair for Arsenal. But Trossard's goal lifted unbeaten the north Londoners into fourth place, two points behind leaders Manchester City as they aim to avenge last season's late collapse in the title race. """"It was a long time without a win here. We played a great game and didn't give anything away. We dominated and the score should probably have been bigger,"""" Arteta said. """"Everton haven't created a single chance. It's about intelligence but also about the fight. """"Against Manchester United I saw my face after and it was a bit of relief. This was enjoyment. We were patient and Leandro produced an incredible finish to win the game."""" Winless Everton remain in the relegation zone as they face up to another relegation battle after narrowly beating the drop in the last two seasons. Sean Dyche's team headed into the game on the back of the news that the club is set to have new owners after Farhad Moshiri agreed to sell his 94 percent stake to American investment fund 777 Partners. The takeover would bring to an end the tumultuous tenure of British-Iranian Moshiri, who first invested in 2016. - Ruthless Arteta - Everton's new owners got an early glimpse into the size of the task facing them as the Toffees suffered a fourth defeat in their opening five league games for the first time since 2005-06. Arteta, a former Everton midfielder, has no such worries as Arsenal prepare for their return to the Champions League after a six-year absence against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday. The Spaniard was rewarded with a clean-sheet from keeper David Raya, who made his Arsenal debut following his move from Brentford as Aaron Ramsdale dropped to the bench. Raya was one of two changes, with Fabio Vieira making his first start since April in place of Kai Havertz. """"It is nothing different. I have 11 players to pick and no-one is different,"""" Arteta said of his ruthless decision to axe Ramsdale. Gabriel Martinelli thought he had given Arsenal the lead their dominance deserved when he slotted home from close-range in the 19th minute, but his effort was disallowed for offside against Eddie Nketiah in the build-up. Gabriel's pass had bounced off Everton forward Beto when Nketiah was ruled to be interfering with play, much to Arsenal's disgust. Adding insult to injury for Martinelli, the Brazilian forward limped off with a muscle injury soon after that incident. Arsenal were in such total command that Everton went the first half an hour without a single touch inside the visitors' penalty area. Ben White's effort was saved by Everton keeper Jordan Pickford, who produced an even better stop to keep out Marin Odegaard's rocket soon after half-time. Everton's Arnaut Danjuma fired onto the roof of the net from distance, but Arsenal finally made their pressure pay off in the 69th minute. A flurry of passes opened up the Everton defence and Bukayo Saka deftly clipped the ball into Trossard, who guided a composed finish into the far corner for his first league goal this season. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Wonderful Wahi helps Lens beat Arsenal 2-1 | The Daily Star","""RC Lens forward Elye Wahi scored one goal and set up another as his side beat Arsenal 2-1 to top Champions League Group B as they celebrated the return of Europe's premium club competition to their turf in flamboyant style on Tuesday. The 20-year-old, who joined from Montpellier during the close season, fed Adrien Thomasson for the first-half equaliser after Gabriel Jesus's opener, before netting the winner in the 69th minute to send the Bollaert-Delelis stadium wild. The result put the Ligue 1 side on four points from two games, one ahead of Arsenal who suffered their first defeat in the group stage of the competition in 10 games. Sevilla are second on two points, one ahead of PSV Eindhoven after the two teams drew 1-1 in the Netherlands. """"Beating Arsenal in the Champions League will surely stay in our memories,"""" Lens coach Franck Haise told a press conference. """"Elye is a young player, he only joined a month and a half ago, he's making big strides."""" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta, who had to cope with Bukayo Saka's early injury substitution, said: """"The difference between today and PSV (when his side won 4-0) was in the boxes. """"There were moments in the second half we could have been more efficient. We took a big lesson today."""" For Lens's first Champions League home game in 21 years, the ground was sold out for the 30th time in a row and the 38,000 crowd were not disappointed as their team continued a return to top form after a mediocre start to the season. Lens had scored at least once in each of their last 33 home games in all European competitions, starting the run against Arsenal in the group stage of the Champions League in 1998-99, and they extended the streak on Tuesday. EARLY CHANCES The hosts had the first clear chances early on as Kevin Danso's attempt on the turn went just wide and Thomasson's header was slightly off target. Arsenal, however, were far more clinical, punishing Lens for their first mistake. Thomasson lost the ball in midfield to Saka, who sent Jesus through and the Brazilian thumped his shot past Brice Samba to put the London side ahead after 14 minutes. Samba's shot-stopping qualities were then put to the test by Kai Havertz but, just as Arsenal felt a sense of control, Thomasson made up for his earlier error in stunning fashion. Wahi stretched to deflect Deiver Machado's long pass into the path of Thomasson, who curled the ball beautifully into the far corner to equalise after 25 minutes. Saka, who limped off the pitch in Arsenal's 4-0 win at Bournemouth in the Premier League at the weekend, was replaced by Fabio Vieira 11 minutes from the interval. """"He tried a backheel and he felt something. It's muscular he couldn't carry on and we had to take him off,"""" said Arteta. The excellent Samba was then forced into an early save in the second half to deny Leandro Trossard.

"Brighton captain Dunk rescues 2-2 draw at home against Liverpool | The Daily Star","""Brighton & Hove Albion captain Lewis Dunk scored with a deft volley to cancel out Mohamed Salah's brace for Liverpool as the Seagulls came from behind to grab a 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Sunday. The home side took the lead in the 20th minute when Simon Adingra picked the pocket of former Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister and fired home, but Salah levelled in the 40th minute, ending a flowing move with a trademark left-foot finish. The Egyptian gave his side the lead from the penalty spot in first-half stoppage time after Dominik Szoboszlai was pulled down by Pascal Gross, and Salah struck his shot to the left of keeper Bart Verbruggen. Substitute Ryan Gravenberch, who came on for Harvey Elliott at halftime, missed a golden chance to put Liverpool two up in the 54th minute when his close-range effort from Szoboszlai's pass cannoned back off the crossbar. Dutchman Gravenberch, who signed for Liverpool from Bayern Munich on the last day of the transfer window, made another fine chance in the 65th minute, but his shot lacked power and was easily saved. Brighton had their chances in the second half and they howled for a penalty in the 69th minute as Kaoru Mitoma cut in from the right and unleashed a shot which they claimed hit the arm of Virgil van Dijk, but the referee disagreed. Brighton forced an equaliser in the 78th minute when Andy Robertson decided against trying to clear Solli March's free kick, allowing defender Dunk to volley home. If Gravenberch's miss was bad, Joao Pedro's for Brighton in the 84th minute was arguably worse as he failed to hit the target from close range with the goal at his mercy, but the hosts held on for the draw to stay sixth in the table on 16 points, one behind third-placed Liverpool. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Sterling stars as Chelsea secure back-to-back league wins | The Daily Star","""Chelsea secured back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time since March after coming from behind to thrash Burnley 4-1 on Saturday. Looking to end a run of four successive home defeats on their return to the top flight this season, promoted Burnley raced into a 15th-minute lead, Wilson Odobert scoring his first goal in English football to stun the visitors. Chelsea offered little in response until Ameen Al Dakhil put through his own net in the most unfortunate circumstances three minutes before the break to get Mauricio Pochettino's team back level. Having failed to win in their last 19 matches when conceding the opening goal in the Premier League, a run dating back to October 2022, Chelsea completed the turnaround early in the second half, Cole Palmer converting from the penalty spot. A fine Sterling goal and a fourth from substitute Nicolas Jackson put the game beyond the hosts, lifting Chelsea to ninth in the standings, with Burnley remaining in the relegation zone with only one win this season. Burnley had won just one of their 16 Premier League matches against Chelsea, a 3-2 away win in 2017 when the Blues were reigning champions, but given the huge overhaul of both squads ahead of this season, such a record will not have been at the forefront of either sides' minds. Both teams began like units who had not quite got used to each other yet, with Palmer's long-range effort that sailed well over the only real effort at goal in the opening exchanges. Sterling whistled one fizzing strike past the post before Odobert collected a pass from Lyle Foster and fired through the legs of Chelsea full back Marc Cucurella into the bottom corner, the 18-year-old becoming Burnley's youngest Premier League goalscorer. Chelsea had plenty of possession for the remainder of the opening period but looked like they were going to be frustrated as the interval approached, only for Al Dakhil to divert Sterling's cross over home goalkeeper James Trafford. Sterling was again at the centre of things five minutes into the second half, drawing a foul from Vitinho to allow Palmer the chance to open his account for Chelsea, which he emphatically fired home. A third always looked like and Conor Gallagher sent Sterling through for the England international to arrow home his third of the season. Jackson's well-taken fourth, set up by Palmer, ensured the Chelsea fans head back to the capital with big smiles on their faces after seeing their team score four or more goals for the first time in 71 matches in all competitions. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Darwin delights as Liverpool defeat West Ham 3-1 | The Daily Star","""Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez netted a brilliant goal as his side romped to a 3-1 Premier League win over a dogged West Ham United side at Anfield on Sunday, deftly steering home a volley on the hour mark. The visitors got off to a flying start when Tomas Soucek forced a brilliant save from Alisson with a downward header in the seventh minute, and two minutes later Michail Antonio headed a Soucek cross wide with the goal at his mercy. But the Hammers were left to rue those early misses when Mohamed Salah was felled by Nayef Aguerd in the 15th minute for a stonewall penalty, and the Egyptian attacker stepped up to smash home the resulting spot kick to give Liverpool the lead. That kick-started the home side, but West Ham still managed to level before the break when Jarrod Bowen dived at the feet of Virgil van Dijk to score with a superb low header for his fourth goal of the season. The goal was eerily similar to the James Ward-Prowse strike that put them ahead against Manchester City a week ago, but once again it wasn't enough to get them anything from the game. After spurning a number of decent chances, Nunez finally got on the scoresheet when he latched on to a beautiful lofted pass from Alexis Mac Allister, much to the delight of the Anfield crowd. That goal took the wind out of the Hammers' sails and substitute Diogo Jota was able to hook home a third goal from Virgil van Dijk's knockdown in the 85th minute, four minutes after coming off the bench. The win leaves Liverpool in second spot in the table on 16 points, two behind leaders Manchester City, while West Ham are seventh on 10 points. After going behind in several early-season games, Liverpool looked much more like their old selves in Sunday's win. """"We are working really hard and everyone can see we have improved a lot since the beginning and this is the way, and we will have to keep working,"""" Alexis Mac Allister said in a post-match TV interview.

"Liverpool too good for Saint-Gilloise, Brighton battle back to hold Marseille | The Daily Star","""Liverpool closed in on the Europa League knockout rounds with a 2-0 win over Union Saint-Gilloise on Thursday, while Brighton fought back to secure their first European point in a thrilling 2-2 draw at Marseille. West Ham's 2-1 at Freiburg saw them set a new record unbeaten streak for an English team in Europe, while Romelu Lukaku was among the scorers in Roma's 4-0 win over Servette. Jurgen Klopp named a strong side at Anfield with the Reds keen to make sure of top spot in Group E and progress directly to the last 16. Saint-Gilloise goalkeeper Anthony Moris had been in inspired form to deny Mohamed Salah early on, but his fumble from Trent Alexander-Arnold's effort left Ryan Gravernberch with a tap-in for his first Liverpool goal on the stroke of half-time. Klopp sent on Alexis Mac Allister at half-time as he came up against his brother Kevin, who started for the Belgians. """"Today my dad was here but I am sure everybody in our family was watching the TV, so it was special,"""" said Alexis Mac Allister. """"I guess he (his dad) cried a little bit."""" Liverpool were made to wait until stoppage time to secure the points as Diogo Jota burst clear on goal and produced a cool finish. The Reds travel to Brighton in the Premier League on Sunday and the Seagulls may well be fatigued after their efforts to snatch a point in southern France. Marseille have struggled so far this season but went 2-0 up thanks to two goals in two minutes midway through the first half. Chancel Mbemba swept the French side into the lead before a slip from Brighton captain Lewis Dunk allowed Jordan Veretout to make it 2-0. Brighton seemed destined for a third consecutive defeat in all competitions, but the momentum swung when Pascal Gross was picked out by Kaoru Mitoma to halve the arrears. Joao Pedro then levelled from the penalty spot after Tariq Lamptey had been upended inside the box two minutes from time to leave Brighton just one point adrift of Marseille and Ajax in Group B. """"I think we are not playing well, it's a very tough period for us in this moment,"""" said Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi. """"To close the first half at 2-0, this reaction is incredible.

""""It's a brilliant achievement, I've said to the boys we need to keep it going,"""" said Hammers boss David Moyes. """"Winning the game tonight was most important."""" Lucas Paqueta put the Europa Conference League winners in front after just eight minutes with a towering header. Roland Sallai levelled for Freiburg early in the second-half. But the Hammers were not to be denied as Nayef Aguerd headed home James Ward-Prowse's corner. European competitions have also been Roma's strong point under Jose Mourinho and the Italians put their poor Serie A form to one side against Servette. Lukaku opened the scoring before an Andrea Belotti brace either side of Lorenzo Pellegrini's strike made it two wins from two for Roma in Group G. Rangers did not get any reaction from the sacking of Michael Beale as the Glasgow giants slumped to an embarrassing 2-1 defeat to Aris Limassol. Former Gers midfielder Steven Davis took temporary charge but could only oversee Aris registering their first ever European group stage victory. Alex Moucketou-Moussounda and Shavy Babicka scored on a famous night for the Cypriots as Abdallah Sima's header proved nothing more than a consolation for Rangers. All four sides in Group C are now on three points after Real Betis bounced back from their 1-0 defeat by Rangers with a 2-1 win over Sparta Prague. In the Europa Conference League, Aston Villa left it very late to see off Bosnian champions Zrinjski Mostar 1-0 as John McGinn headed in a 94th-minute winner.

Erling Haaland was left on the bench by City coach Pep Guardiola for the full 90 minutes and his presence was missed in a toothless display. Eddie Howe also rang the changes from an 8-0 thrashing of Sheffield United at the weekend. But it was not until the Newcastle boss introduced Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes at half-time that the hosts took control. Isak had the simple task of slotting home at the far post after a burst from Joelinton opened up the City defence. """"A win like this can elevate us,"""" said Howe. """"First-half we tried to rotate the squad and keep our players fresh.

The Senegalese's wastefulness in front of goal has been partly to blame for the Blues' return of one win in their opening six Premier League games under Mauricio Pochettino.

Arsenal were also 1-0 winners at Brentford as Aaron Ramsdale responded to being controversially dropped by Mikel Arteta. Reiss Nelson's eighth-minute goal separated the sides despite a Brentford onslaught after the break. Arteta has preferred David Raya to Ramsdale in goal for the past three games.

Arsenal will travel to West Ham in the next round after the Hammers were 1-0 winners at third-tier Lincoln. Liverpool trailed to Championship leaders Leicester after just three minutes before fighting back to win 3-1. Kasey McAteer rounded off a rapid counter-attack to give the Foxes a flying start. Jurgen Klopp's men laid seige to the visitors' goal but were made to wait until after the break to draw level. The equaliser was made in the Netherlands as Ryan Gravenberch set up Cody Gakpo to find the far corner. Klopp then turned to his bench to find a winner and found it through a stunning strike from Dominik Szoboszlai. The Hungarian captain took aim from outside the box and smashed the ball into the top corner 20 minutes from time.

In a red-hot atmosphere in the north east, PSG had no answer to the relentless hosts who raced into a 17th-minute lead through Miguel Almiron, before Dan Burn powered home a header six minutes before the break to double Newcastle's advantage. The crowd ensured there was no let-up after the break, with Sean Longstaff drilling a third under the arm of Gianluigi Donnarumma in the PSG goal five minutes into the second half to send the Newcastle fans into dreamland. A goal out of nowhere from Lucas Hernandez got the visitors back in it, before a stoppage-time fourth from defender Fabian Schar capped a stunning victory that moved Newcastle top of Group F on four points, one clear of PSG in second. PSG suffered their heaviest group-stage defeat in the Champions League since losing 3-0 against Chelsea in September 2004, and conceded four in a single group game in the competition for the first time since a 3-4 defeat to Deportivo La Coruna in March 2001.

"Morata scores twice as Atletico thrash Rayo 7-0 | The Daily Star","""An inspired Atletico Madrid humiliated city rivals Rayo Vallecano with a 7-0 demolition job on Monday, with substitute Alvaro Morata scoring twice and midfielders Saul Niguez and Rodrigo de Paul giving two assists each. Atletico took an early two-goal lead with Antoine Griezmann and Memphis Depay scoring from close range, while Nahuel Molina extended their lead in the 36th minute in a counter-attack. Griezmann netted a close-range volley in the second minute from a De Paul cross. Depay almost extended Atletico's lead two minutes later but his point-blank strike was brilliantly stopped by goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski. He ended up scoring in the 16th minute after Saul delivered a low cross and the Dutch striker tapped in from just inside the six-yard-box. Dapay had to be substitute a few minutes little after he injured his leg. De Paul then found Molina and the defender netted a tidy finish past Dimitrievski. In the second half Morata, who had replaced Depay, netted twice, while Angel Correa fired a brilliant dipping strike over the goalkeeper. Marcos Llorente was also on target as a rampant Atletico ripped apart their rivals to secure a second win in three games this season.

Chatting with Venezuelan international Josef Martinez, likely to be his strike partner for Miami, Messi was watched by over 200 media representatives who had attended the session. Miami's training sessions had barely attracted double figure attendance from the media prior to Messi's arrival. Messi had been unveiled to the club's supporters at the stadium on Sunday at a celebratory event alongside Miami co-owner David Beckham and his first game is scheduled for Friday.

Inter coach Gerard """"Tata"""" Martino, the former Argentina and Barcelona player, says Messi has been """"liberated"""" by finally leading Argentina to the World Cup last year after several agonising major championship near-misses.

Messi appeared to pour cold water on that prospect in comments made in June, saying he did not expect to play in the 2026 finals. Argentina's World Cup-winning manager Lionel Scaloni, however, is certainly in no mood to force the issue. """"The door will always be open.

"Miami draw with Orlando without ex-Barca trio | The Daily Star","""Inter Miami, without Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, battled to a 1-1 draw at Orlando City in Major League Soccer on Sunday. The result leaves Miami five points adrift of the last playoff spot with five games of their regular season campaign remaining. Miami can win their second trophy of the Messi era on Wednesday when they look to add the U.S. Open Cup to the League Cup they won last month and with that goal in mind head coach Gerardo Martino took no risks with his line-up. As well as Messi and Alba, both ruled out for fitness reasons, Martino opted to rest Spanish midfielder Busquets who had been ever-present since joining the club in July. With homegrown youngsters Noah Allen and David Ruiz brought into the side, Miami fielded a line-up similar to the ones that had seen the team fall to the bottom of the Eastern Conference before Messi's arrival. Orlando, second in the East and already assured of a playoff place, began the brighter and could have grabbed the lead in the 29th minute when striker Duncan McGuire found himself in space on the edge of the box but his shot was well saved by Drake Callender. At the other end, in-form Ecuadorean striker Leonard Campana went close for Miami with a header from a corner which Orlando keeper Pedro Gallese got down well to. Miami broke through in the 52nd minute when Campana fed Josef Martinez whose low shot was parried out but David Ruiz slid in the loose ball. Callender did well again to keep out a curling left-footed effort from Martin Ojeda and then Orlando wasted another chance when Ivan Angulo found himself clear on goal but poked his shot wide. But the home side finally got their reward in the 66th minute when a deflected pass fell into the path of McGuire who drilled a first-time shot through the legs of Callender. Miami tired badly in the final stages as they hung on for a point. """"They are a very competitive team just like us and we just try to fight through and get the get the win,"""" said Ruiz.

"Miami, without Messi, lose US Open Cup final | The Daily Star","""The Houston Dynamo defeated Inter Miami 2-1 to win the U.S. Open Cup on Wednesday with an injured Lionel Messi watching from the stands at DRV PNK Stadium. Without Messi and his former Barcelona team-mate Jordi Alba, Miami struggled to compete with an enterprising Houston and could have little to complain about the outcome. Miami co-owner David Beckham, who watched the game with his former Real Madrid team-mate Zinedine Zidane, had hoped for another night of celebration for his club after their Leagues Cup triumph last month. But Miami lacked intensity and ideas as they were given the runaround by Ben Olsen's impressive Houston team. No clear explanation has been given for Messi's injury with references to """"muscle fatigue"""" followed by talk from coach Gerardo Martino of """"scars"""" from an old injury. The World Cup-winner was withdrawn in the first half of the MLS win over Toronto last week and sat out Sunday's draw at Orlando City. With no Messi to worry about, Houston were on top from the outset, moving the ball around with confidence and purpose while Miami with Sergio Busquets the only one of their trio of ex-Barca players on the field, struggled to get a foothold in the game. Drake Callender was forced into a double save when Nelson Quinones drove towards the far post, the Miami keeper pushing the ball out and then doing well to get his legs to the follow up from Corey Bair. But Houston grabbed the lead in the 24th minute with a perfect counter-attack ending with Brazilian Artur feeding the overlapping Griffin Dorsey who blasted in at the near post. Houston were utterly dominant, passing the ball with a swiftness that left Miami chasing shadows and it wasn't long before they had doubled their advantage. Colombian winger Quinones cut into the box from the left flank and Miami right-back DeAndre Yedlin's desperate lunge brought him crashing to the ground. French forward Amine Bassi made no mistake from the spot to make it 2-0. Miami coach Gerard Martino made two changes at the break, bringing on Venezuelan striker Josef Martinez and Ecuadorean midfielder Dixon Arroyo. Martinez had a chance to get Miami back into the game in the 56th minute, heading wide from a good position before Benjamin Cremaschi forced Dynamo keeper Andrew Tarbell into a low save. But as Inter pushed forward in search of a goal, Houston broke away and looked to have finished the contest off when Quinones scored after being set up by Bassi but the effort was ruled out for offside after a VAR review. Martinez gave Miami some late hope with a left-foot strike in stoppage time after latching on to a ball from Argentine Facundo Farias. But it was too little, too late from Miami and Houston deservedly won their second U.S. Open Cup to add to their triumph in 2018. Miami had won the Leagues Cup last month with Messi prominently involved but they must now battle to make the Major League Soccer play-offs with uncertainty over their Argentine star's fitness. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Messi goes to Hollywood as Miami seek to close playoff gap | The Daily Star","""Lionel Messi and Inter Miami face the MLS champions as their bid to make the playoffs takes them to Los Angeles on Sunday. Los Angeles FC are second in the Western Conference and represent one of the toughest tests for a Miami team that are 10 points outside of the playoff places with 10 games remaining. Miami's attempt to surge into the post-season, after a winless run of 11 games in MLS before Messi's arrival left them rock bottom of the league, suffered a blow on Wednesday when they were held to a goalless draw at home to Nashville. That disappointing result came after a 2-0 win at New York Red Bulls last Saturday in Messi's first outing in the regular season. """"We have tunnel vision on our goal, which is making the playoffs, so this feels like a loss, but we're just going to keep moving forward,"""" said Canadian defender Kamal Miller after Wednesday's draw. Messi had led Miami to victory in the mid-season Leagues Cup tournament and into the final of the US Open Cup, and has already scored 11 goals in all competitions. But he was well below his best against Nashville, raising concerns about whether the intense schedule since his debut has taken a toll. """"We got a little too accustomed to titles, finals, winning in New York, but we have to keep going because a lot can still happen,"""" said Argentine coach Gerardo """"Tata"""" Martino. LAFC are seven points behind Western Conference leaders St.Louis City but are expected to be among the favorites for MLS Cup again. More than Messi Head coach Steve Cherundolo insists his team cannot fall into the trap of focusing purely on the threat from Messi. """"There is a lot of buzz around Messi and the newfound Miami strength and results that they're stringing together. But for us, it's another home game that we want to win and I think it's a mistake to focus on one player,"""" he told reporters. The former USA international said even if such a plan could be constructed it would be a pointless exercise given the talent of the seven-times Ballon d'Or winner. """"I think because of obviously his ability and the way he plays, it's an illusion to try to think you're going to stop him for 90 minutes. He's going to have a chance or two. """"That's just the way this game works and the way he's been able to do throughout his career against every team,"""" he said. """"If you try and focus on that, then you're going to miss out on opportunities to actually beat Miami. And that's where our focus is in making sure that they as a collective have to defend, they as a collective have to work hard and put a very intense and tough shift to beat us,"""" he said. The other stand-out game of the weekend is Saturday's derby clash in the Pacific North West between the Seattle Sounders and the Portland Timbers. While third placed Seattle should be comfortably on their way to the post-season, Portland have work to do sitting in 12th but only four points adrift of the last playoff spot. The derby has a long history going back to when the two clubs met in the old NASL in the 1970s and continued in various leagues before the teams moved into MLS.

"Blow for Messi, Miami MLS playoff hopes as Cincinnati clinch | The Daily Star","""FC Cincinnati led the way into the Major League Soccer playoffs on Wednesday as the slim post-season hopes of Lionel Messi's Inter Miami took a hit with a goalless draw against Nashville. Second-half goals from Luciano Acosta and Brandon Vazquez lifted Cincinnati to a 2-1 victory at Atlanta, where Colombian Edwin Mosquera's first MLS goal had put the hosts ahead in the 10th minute. The victory was Cincinnati's first at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and took the Eastern Conference leaders to 57 points and the first berth in the MLS Cup playoffs with eight matches remaining in the regular season. Miami, meanwhile, made little headway in their unlikely bid to make the playoffs as they were held scoreless for the first time in the 10 games of the Messi era. The Argentine star had scored 11 goals in nine appearances since joining Inter Miami -- including their run to the Leagues Cup crown, in a US Open Cup semi-final and in his regular-season debut off the bench in New York on Saturday. The workload may have finally caught up with him on Wednesday as he was unable to work the magic again in front of another star-studded crowd at a blustery DRV PNK Stadium, where boxing great Floyd Mayweather and FIFA chief Gianni Infantino were among the spectators. The draw left Miami 10 points out of the final playoff spot with 10 games remaining They travel across the country to take on MLS Cup champions Los Angeles FC on Sunday. Messi and former Barcelona teammate Sergio Busquets both started the game after coming off the bench in the 60th minute in New York. Despite controlling possession throughout a frustrating first half, Miami struggled to create real chances against Nashville's disciplined defense. Miami fans were on the edge of their seats after Messi drew a foul on Nashville's Dax McCarty in the 60th minute and stepped up to take a free kick, but his effort to the bottom left corner was gathered in by Nashville goalkeeper Elliott Panicco. Nashville's Hany Mukhtar had a goal erased by an offside call in the 69th minute. Messi had another free kick from a dangerous position in the 83rd minute but his shot caromed harmlessly off the wall of defenders. In Atlanta, Mosquera blasted home a deflected cross to put the hosts up early. Acosta leveled the score with his 13th goal of the season in the 75th minute, spliting two defenders and playing a pass to Junior MOreno, who headed the ball down to Acosta who beat Atlanta keeper Brad Guzan with a one-time shot into the top corner.

"Messi's Miami almost double season ticket prices; fans upset | The Daily Star","""Fans of Lionel Messi's Inter Miami are up in arms after the Major League Soccer club doubled season ticket prices for next season, but the chance to watch the World Cup winner will still tempt many into forking out the cash. The club, co-owned by Miami businessman Jorge Mas and former England player David Beckham, emailed fans on Thursday with details of their ticket renewal prices. This season's cheapest season ticket was $485 but the 'Messi effect' means that has risen to $884 for a place behind the goal for the 17 home MLS games. That comes out at $52 per match. Seats offering a broader view, close to the half-way line with access to a food and drink 'club' area, have risen from $3,600 to $7,650 and there are similar rises for the most expensive seats. The cheapest season ticket to watch European and Premier League champions Manchester City is $469 with the most expensive costing $1,256 although hospitality deals are seperate from season tickets. At Messi's former club Barcelona, the lowest price for a season pass is $380.53 with the most costly $919.62. Season ticket holders this season have been protected from the massive surge in single match ticket prices for Miami games prompted by Messi's arrival in July. Indeed, some have cashed in by selling their season ticket access to individual games on the secondary ticket market for significant mark-ups. Fans will be able to downgrade their seats to cheaper options if they wish and a club source said that they have an extensive waiting list for season tickets. The club are in just the fourth season of their existence and the annoyance is particularly acute among fans who spent years hoping to have an MLS team to support. Ed Serrano, who was one of the leaders of the campaign to bring an MLS franchise to South Florida, spending years lobbying league officials and holding events to build support, said he knows of many fans who are thinking of not renewing. """"It's crazy. I expected them to go up, but maximum 50%. These guys are just thinking about making money and there is a lot of demand so they think they will get away with it,"""" he told AFP. """"Maybe they are looking for just the elite to watch the games and forget about other people. They are going to lose people like this if they continue with this mentality,"""" he said.  New stadium The club plan to move from their temporary DRV PNK Stadium, in Fort Lauderdale in 2025, to a new site Miami Freedom Park, by Miami International Airport. The $350 million stadium will be part of a reported $1 billion retail, entertainment, office and hotel development. That switch to the new home is scheduled for the last year of Messi's $150 million deal with the club. A club source said that the price rise reflects the changes on the field after bringing in Messi, along with former Spain internationals Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, as well as the broader investments being made. But Serrano fears the cost increase may damage the building of a fan base for the future. """"One day Messi will be gone....they aren't thinking in the big picture. It is the hardcore that they are chasing away and they may never come back,"""" he said. Some fans who have already been prepared to commit large sums to secure seats are rethinking their approach for next season. Jeffrey Skatoff of Palm Beach Gardens, who spent over $20,000 on seven season tickets for family and friends, said the renewal price he was quoted saw the total rise to $53,550. """"I liked having seven season tickets. I could give them away or bring casual fans to games, because the price was decent. Now I will probably go from seven season tickets down to two,"""" he said. Serrano, known among Inter fans as 'Uncle Ed' says that despite his strong objections, he will likely still fork out the money. """"I'm just so shocked by all this. I was contemplating boycotting but I love the team too much and fought so hard to get a team that I can't bring myself to do it"""". দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Courtois ‘redemption’ disrupts hegemony of strikers | Daily Star","""Ahead of the biggest night of European club football, numerous tactical analysis, speculations and predictions were made on how the match between Liverpool and Real Madrid would play out. In football, a game where goals define the result, marksmen like Karim Benzema, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Vinicius Jr. predictably garnered the most attention on the occasion. And all but certainly, nobody anticipated that a goalkeeper would decide the outcome of the Champions League final at Stade de France on Sunday; and he was none other than Real's Thibaut Courtois. The Belgian shot-stopper denied Liverpool nine times throughout the match, the highest number of saves made by any keeper in an UCL final since 2003/04. Notably also, Los Blancos' number one pulled off a record number of 59 saves in a Champions League campaign since the aforementioned period. The Belgian's resistance began from the 16th minute of the match when Courtois dropped down sharply to his left to deny Salah's close-range effort, which sparked the ignition in him for the rest of the match. Five minutes later, a long-range effort from Mane stretched the six and a half feet keeper to his right to finger-tip the ball away from danger. As Real got the lead around the hour mark, Liverpool came firing in all cylinders. However, the Belgian appeared taller than his stature in front of the goal as he frustrated the reds on several occasions. When Salah drifted in from the right and crafted a curler on the far corner from outside the box in the 64th minute, Liverpool fans probably had their fingers crossed in optimism. However, Courtois's high-flying dive to the right parried the ball away from target. And moments later, Salah's attempt to avenge for the Kyiv 2018 final had to wait another day as the Belgian closed his shot down from a tight angle in the near-post. The Courtois show continued as he denied the Egyptian forward, yet again, who was free on goal and his shot was elevated away by the Madrid keeper's spectacular reflex in the 83rd minute. As the final was heading towards its last minutes, Courtois probably had recalled his previous Champions League final, when he was playing against Real and Atletico Madrid was leading by a goal. But a thumping header from Sergio Ramos in the 93rd minute spoiled his first UCL final. Conversely, this time playing for Los Blancos, he wouldn't allow history to repeat for himself this time around. His sharpness and ice-cold nerves till the final whistle ensured that the Spanish giants could keep their lead intact and head towards their 14th Champions League title. """"It's incredible, so many years, so much work. Come to the club of my life. I saw many criticising me. Today we have shown who is the King of Europe,"""" Courtois said after the match. """"I needed to win a final for my career, to put some respect on my name."""" The initial days Courtois spent at Real after signing from Chelsea were dim, to say the least, as he had a hard time fitting in as his low confidence during the games cost his side to lose games on multiple occasions. He had to talk with psychologists to get his focus back on the game and the result arrived in flying colours as he won two league titles with Real Madrid and when the Los Blancos needed him the most, he rose to the occasion and single-handedly won his first Champions League. """"I saw a lot of tweets saying I will get humbled.

With just four minutes on the clock, Ronaldo gave his side the perfect start against an Al-Ahli side that included Roberto Firmino, Riyad Mahrez and Allan Saint-Maximin. The Portuguese forward collected a Sadio Mane pass before capitalising on some poor defending and slotting past the goalkeeper through a plume of smoke following some pre-game pyrotechnics - despite not being able to see the goal. Ronaldo celebrated in trademark style after notching his seventh goal of the season, and he later found the net again to secure the win for his side. Former Benfica midfielder Anderson Talisca bagged himself a brace either side of ex-AC Milan man Frank Kessie pulling a goal back for Al-Ahli in the first half. Riyad Mahrez then scored his second goal for Al-Ahli since joining from Manchester City, slotting home an early second-half penalty. Ronaldo snuffed out any hope of a comeback just two minutes later when he notched his second goal of the evening from a Talisca assist. Firas Al Buraikan pulled a late goal back for Al-Ahli but it was not enough to deny Al-Nasr and Ronaldo the victory. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star now has eight goals in just five appearances, helping Al-Nasr to a four-game winning run that has brought them back in to title contention. They now sit just three points behind Nuno Espirito Santo's league-leading Al-Ittihad side. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Saudi Pro League here to stay! | The Daily Star","""Links of Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid, rumours of Neymar returning to Barcelona have been the commonalities of the transfer market over the past few years. This summer, however, in addition to the aforementioned sagas, the emergence of one major entity -- the Saudi Pro League -- has taken the transfer market by storm. The stage was set late last year, though, after an unprecedented deal worth $200m-per-year saw one of the biggest names in football, Cristiano Ronaldo, move to Al Nassr from English giant Manchester United in the January 2023 transfer window. Not only did that sensational move put Al Nassr on the map, it inevitably opened floodgates to the cash-rich Saudi Pro League. It is vividly evident this summer as a host of big names followed in the footsteps of arguably the most influential player of all time. His former teammate in Real Madrid and the reigning Ballon d'Or winner, Karim Benzema, had tongues wagging with his move for free from the 14-time Champions League winners to Al Ittihad -- one of four clubs alongside Al Hilal, Al Ahli, and Al Nassr owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. German champions Bayern Munich saw Sadio Mane join Ronaldo at Al Nassr, Riyad Mahrez went to Al Ahli just after helping Manchester City to an era-defining continental treble. Meanwhile, N'Golo Kante, Ruben Neves, Edouard Mendy, and Kalidou Koulibaly all have been just a part of the major influx of players from Europe to Saudi Arabia. Such big names being lured out of a continent that has ruled the sport for ages was bound to strike a nerve; and it did. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp thought the fact that the Saudi transfer window closes on September 20, three weeks after it shuts in Europe, would have a """"detrimental effect"""" on the sport. Meanwhile, according to City manager Pep Guardiola, the Saudi league has """"completely changed the market"""" while Klopp admitted it is something that the European managers now """"need to deal with"""". With the Saudi league creating more adversaries than cohorts, the most scathing judgment on the league was probably passed by Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who saw one of his summer targets Marcelo Brozovic choose Al Nassr over a move to the Spanish club. According to Laporta, the gold rush to the oil-rich Gulf state has """"no sporting reasons"""", hinting at unmatchable, and at times outrageous, deals offered by the Saudi clubs being the sole motivator for players. Even though the Saudi league has reportedly failed in their attempts to get seven-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi and 24-year-old Mbappe, who has already let PSG know of his willingness to switch, a suggestion that the league offers no sporting reasons to players is arguably harsh. While Ronaldo left for the Saudi league at 37 with the best parts of his glittering career in the rear-view mirror, it remains hard to consider someone as professional as the Portuguese would choose to jump ship only due to financial incentives -- especially since lack of a promising sporting plan and infrastructure had somewhat contributed to Ronaldo's decision in cutting ties with Manchester United despite having been their previous season's best player. It is true that other than Ronaldo's countrymen Neves, 26, most players that moved to Saudi are in their thirties. But that still does not mean that the likes of Kante, Benzema, Mahrez, Mane, Roberto Firmino, Mendy, and Allex Telles are done making claims for their respective national teams. On the contrary, most are mainstays in their national sides -- a fact that only shows that the Saudi league is far from being a retirement destination for players. Also, Al Nassr refusing to go ahead with a deal for Chelsea star Hakim Ziyech following a reported knee injury implies that the Saudi project is not just about raking up the big names in football but one that prioritises a long-term vision -- unlike the case of the Chinese Super League, another Asian league that had injected serious cash to be a footballing force in the last decade but failed to see their vision through. What the Saudi league is yet to do is convince more players in their mid-20s -- the period when footballers are primed to leave their marks on the global stage -- move to the Middle Eastern nation and still maintain their status quo as one of the top talents around the globe. As things stand, the big spenders in Europe and the producers of footballing prospects around the globe are now well-aware of another major player in the market who could lure away their assets and targets. And it is probably going to stay for a while, relentlessly pushing to make Ronaldo's prophecy of the Saudi Pro League becoming """"one of the top five leagues in the world"""". দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Mbappe visits father's native Cameroon | The Daily Star","""France's star footballer Kylian Mbappe arrived in Cameroon to an ecstatic welcome from fans Thursday for a visit that includes charity work with deaf children and a trip to his father's village. Many among the hundreds who greeted the 24-year-old forward were dressed in his Paris Saint-Germain team's football jersey for the occasion. They excitedly screamed his name as he emerged from the airport in the capital Yaounde, according to an AFP journalist. A group of about a hundred traditional dancers performed in his honour. Smiling widely, the footballer waved to the crowd who were kept at a distance by police, before being whisked away in an SUV with tinted windows. """"We are proud to see our Cameroonian brother. We want to offer him a very warm welcome,"""" high-school student Vannel Kunde, 16, enthused. Mbappe, who is also captain of France's national team, will stay during his visit lasting several days at a hotel complex belonging to the family of French former tennis champion Yannick Noah, who lives in Yaounde. On Friday, he is due to visit a school for youngsters who are deaf and hard of hearing in the capital's suburbs, according to his itinerary seen by AFP. He is also set to take part in a basketball game, with expectations it will involve retired NBA player Joakim Noah, the son of Yannick. Later on, he takes part in a football match against second division Cameroon club FC Vent d'Etoudi. Saturday sees him head to the economic capital, Douala, to visit a school and then go to Djebale, his father Wilfried Mbappe's village. His father left Cameroon at a young age for France where he became a football trainer. 'Follow in ancestors' footsteps' The trip is an opportunity for Mbappe to visit in Yaounde and Douala two schools supported by his own charitable foundation, Inspired by KM, his team in Paris said in a statement. It's also a chance to """"follow in the footsteps of his ancestors in Djebale, to spend time with young Cameroonians"""", it added. Arsene Pinlap, 37, one of those waiting to catch a glimpse of Mbappe at the airport, spoke of """"a pride"""" as a Cameroonian in welcoming the star to the west African country. """"But it's also an honour to be able to see the best player in the world,"""" said the president of the PSG fan club in Yaounde. Another fan, 18-year-old schoolgirl Armelle Ntsama said: """"It's a great joy for us, the children who love football."""" The French footballer is also due to meet some of the country's officials, including Prime Minister Joseph Dion Ngute, his team said in the statement, adding he would discuss projects he would like to set up in Cameroon. The visit comes amid ongoing questions about Mbappe's future at Paris Saint-Germain. Mbappe declared last month that he would not extend his contract, which expires next year, but has indicated he wants to remain for a final season. The club must therefore sell the player in the current transfer window, otherwise they will likely lose him for nothing when his deal ends. On Wednesday, PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi insisted that Mbappe """"must sign a new contract"""" if he wants to remain at the club next season. He joined PSG from Monaco in August 2017 in a 180-million-euro ($196-million) deal and has gone on to establish himself as one of the world's most prominent players. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Dortmund deny Dembele's sale to Barca is 'close' | The Daily Star","""Borussia Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on Thursday rubbished claims by Barcelona's general manager Pep Segura that the Spanish giants were 'close' to signing the German club's want-away winger Ousmane Dembele. """"Barcelona have not managed to fulfil their wish to complete Dembele's transfer -- until now, they aren't one millimetre closer,"""" Watzke told German magazine Kicker. Watzke's comments referred to Segura's claim on Wednesday that Barcelona are """"close"""" to completing a deal for Dembele as well as Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho. Dembele, 20, has a contract until 2021 and was suspended indefinitely by Dortmund last week for skipping training in a personal protest to pressure the German club to sell him to Barcelona. The Frenchman is suspended for Dortmund's opening Bundesliga match against Wolfsburg on Saturday, which is an unwelcome distraction for new Borussia coach Peter Bosz. """"It is not possible to completely blend it out, but I try to focus on the players who are here, which he isn't,"""" said Bosz when asked about Dembele. """"I don't know what will happen, we have to be patient for a few more days.""""

"Struggling Dortmund face must-win Ruhr derby | The Daily Star","""Elsewhere, Bayern Munich hope to consolidate their grip on top spot with a win at Borussia Moenchengladbach, while RB Leipzig host Werder Bremen. This weekend, though, all eyes will be on the Ruhr derby, as Dortmund host Schalke. Dortmund have not won a league game since September, and have lost five of their last nine in all competitions, leaving their hopes of challenging for the title in tatters. Having held a five-point lead at the top of the table earlier in the season, Dortmund are now nine points behind leaders Bayern, having slipped down to fifth place. Among those to have overtaken them are local rivals Schalke, who have climbed up to second, adding even more spice to Saturday's derby. While Dortmund have been the dominant force in the Ruhr in recent years, the German media are now cautiously predicting a shift in power towards Schalke. In terms of both points and pride, the derby is a must-win game for Dortmund. """"We have to win on Saturday. We simply have to win,"""" said Bosz after Dortmund's defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday. Bosz is under immense pressure to turn things around, his job security dwindling with every defeat. At the beginning of the week, Bild reported that the Dutchman had two games to save himself. Having been knocked out of the Champions League, Saturday's derby may be his last stand. Captain Marcel Schmelzer, however, said that the players, not the coach, were responsible for Dortmund's calamitous defending and ineffective attack. """"We're completely behind Peter Bosz,"""" said Schmelzer on Tuesday. """"We as players are responsible. The coach prepares us for every opponent, but we are responsible for what happens on the pitch."""" - Schalke surging - While Dortmund have struggled, Schalke have quietly found form, surging up the standings on the back of a six-game unbeaten run. Schalke's last defeat in a competitive match came back in September and now lead the chasing pack behind Bayern. Victory against Dortmund would see them move six points clear of their local rivals. """"Dortmund's current situation won't play a decisive role,"""" goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann told Kicker. """"The derby is always like a cup game, a knockout game. """"It's a lot about how much heart you have, and we have heart."""" Faehrmann and his team will be further heartened by the prospective return of midfield star Leon Goretzka. Sidelined for the last four weeks, Goretzka returned to training on Wednesday, and hopes to make his Bundesliga return in the derby. Elsewhere, Bayern look to bounce back from a difficult week when they travel to Moenchengladbach. Despite winning a ninth game in a row under Jupp Heynckes, Wednesday's 2-1 victory over Anderlecht was an unhappy occasion for Bayern, with both Arjen Robben and Thiago Alcantara picking up injuries. The pair join Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller and Franck Ribery on Bayern's star-studded injury list, leaving Heynckes with limited options against Gladbach. Sebastian Rudy and Corentin Tolisso are both expected to start on Saturday. Fellow title contenders RB Leipzig, meanwhile, will be full of confidence after their 4-1 win in Monaco on Tuesday. Six points behind Bayern, Leipzig will be looking to narrow the gap this weekend, though they too have injury problems, with Marcel Sabitzer having suffered a blow to the shoulder in midweek.

"Russian man admits to Dortmund team bus bombing | The Daily Star","""""""I deeply regret my actions,"""" said the man, identified only as Sergei W. in keeping with German convention in court cases to protect the identity of defendants. In a statement handed to the court in the western German city, he insisted he did not aim to kill or hurt anyone. The triple blast last April 11 shattered the team bus's windows and left Spanish international Marc Bartra, 26, with a broken wrist, while a police officer suffered inner ear damage. Prosecutors say the three fragmentation bombs each contained up to a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of a hydrogen peroxide mixture and around 65 cigarette-sized metal bolts, one of which ended up lodged in Bartra's headrest. After initial fears of a jihadist attack were dismissed, W. was arrested 10 days later. Police charged the 28-year-old electrical technician with 28 counts of attempted murder as well as setting off explosions and causing serious bodily harm. He had allegedly remotely set off the three explosive devices hidden in a hedge as the bus was leaving the team hotel for a Champions League match. Prosecutors charge that W. had sought to profit from an anticipated plunge in the club's stock market value by cashing in on so-called put options, essentially bets on a falling share price. He was staying in the same Dortmund hotel as the players, had a view of where the bombs went off and had bought the put options on the team's shares on the day of the attack, prosecutors said. W. reportedly drew attention at the hotel, first by insisting on a window room facing the front and then, in the chaos after the blasts, by calmly walking into its restaurant to order a steak. Dortmund, also known as BVB, is the only football club in Germany that is listed on the stock exchange. If its share price had indeed plunged, W. could have made as much as 500,000 euros ($600,000) in profit, say prosecutors. Instead, W. allegedly sold the options days after the attack, making just 5,900 euros. A day after the attack, Dortmund played their postponed game against Monaco and lost, prompting then coach Thomas Tuchel to rail against UEFA for not giving the players time to come to terms with their fear before returning to the pitch. W. faces life in prison if found guilty, although in Germany parole is usually granted after 15 years. The trial is expected to run for 16 more days of hearings. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Ten-man Dortmund beat Hoffenheim to go top | The Daily Star","""Borussia Dortmund will spend the night atop the Bundesliga table for the first time since the penultimate round of last season, winning 3-1 at Hoffenheim on Friday despite finishing with 10 men. Taking the lead early through Niclas Fuellkrug's first goal for the club, Dortmund conceded almost immediately, Mats Hummels giving away a clumsy penalty to allow Andrej Kramaric to equalise from the spot. Marco Reus scored with a spectacular, acrobatic attempt to edge Dortmund ahead again in first half injury time, the former captain's third goal in three games. With Dortmund withstanding waves of Hoffenheim attacks, wing-back Ramy Bensebaini picked up two yellow cards in four second-half minutes and was sent off. Defender Julian Ryerson added the third goal, scoring on the counter in the fifth minute of injury time. """"It was an important win for us"""" said Dortmund coach Edin Terzic, """"but there's room to improve."""" """"After the red card it was another game. We showed another side of ourselves, we showed we wanted to defend the victory."""" Captain Gregor Kobel said the win """"wasn't as dominant as we wanted"""" but credited his teammates for doing """"those small things, which maybe aren't so spectacular"""" to secure the win. Despite an unbeaten start to the league, Dortmund came into the match under pressure, with Terzic's side failing to impress. Hoffenheim defender John Brooks gifted Dortmund the early lead, allowing the ball to slip to on-rushing Julian Brandt, who let the ball roll into the path of Fuellkrug, the striker blasting home. With Dortmund comfortable and in control, it was their turn to invite the opposition into the game, Hummels bringing down Anton Stach on the edge of the box. Having awarded a free kick, the referee then pointed to the spot on VAR review, before Kramaric sent Kobel the wrong way to level the scores. With the first half winding down, Dortmund retook the lead through a piece of individual brilliance, Malen barrelling his way down the right flank and laying on a cross for Reus to score. Fearing a first loss of the season Hoffenheim roared out of the blocks and looked certain to equalise early in the second half, Grischa Proemel forcing a desperate close-range save from Kobel just before Robert Skov's free kick rattled the bar. Disjointed but holding on, Bensebaini handed his coach another challenge, picking up two yellow cards in four minutes -- the second for kicking the ball away in frustration -- reducing his side to ten men. Terzic made all of his five changes as the clock wound down and Ryerson celebrated his 100th Bundesliga match, scoring on the counter to deliver the visitors to the top of the table.

His retirement comes after a season in which he has hardly featured for Stefano Pioli's side after being plagued with injuries, returning in February following surgery on his left knee in May. In July he signed a deal which netted him around one million euros ($1.02 million) in fixed salary, with large bonuses linked to appearances and achievements. But after agreeing that deal the 41-year-old only started one match and netted once for Milan, a 3-1 win at Udinese in March in which he became the oldest goal scorer in Serie A history. He then picked up a calf injury in a pre-match warm up in April and ended his career sidelined, scotching rumours that he was set to move to Monza and targeting Euro 2024 with Sweden. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Milan clubs both win in Serie A ahead of UCL showdown | The Daily Star","""AC Milan and Inter Milan secured matching 2-0 victories over Roman clubs as they briefly swopped places in Serie A ahead of their Champions League semi-final clash. Milan briefly jumped from sixth to fourth, leapfrogging Inter, with a home victory over second-place Lazio in the early game. """"We played a great game. Now there is plenty of time to recover ahead of the semi-final against Inter,"""" said Milan coach Stefano Pioli. """"Now let's think about the Champions League."""" Inter then jumped back to fourth when they won away at Roma, keeping Jose Mourinho's team outside the European places. Inter coach, Simone Inzaghi said the Champions League semi-final would be """"a showdown played over 180 minutes."""" """"We know what we have to do,"""" he added. At the San Siro, Ismael Bennacer pounced on a loose ball in the Lazio area and thrashed his shot home to give AC Milan the lead in the 17th minute. After 29 minutes, wingback Theo Hernandez collected a roll-out from goalkeeper Mike Maignan on the edge of the Milan box. After shrugging off an early challenge the Frenchman ran unhindered deep into the Lazio half before thumping a dipping 30-metre shot past Ivan Provedel. Lazio did not manage a shot on target, although Toma Basic scuffed a close-range chance in the dying seconds. The two Milan clubs meet in the first leg of a Champions League semi-final on Wednesday and both seemed to have an eye on that match. Milan withdrew Rafael Leao after 10 minutes. The winger indicated to the bench that he had a thigh problem and, after a discussion, was replaced. 'Stopped in time' """"He stopped in time,"""" said Pioli. """"We'll see tomorrow. At the end of the game he was serene, he felt good, I don't think it's something particularly serious."""" """"We are able to play a great game even without him."""" Inter left several regular attacking starters on the bench against injury- hit Roma. Edin Dzeko and Henrikh Mkhitaryan remained spectators throughout while Lautauro Martinez appeared for the last 30 minutes. Left back Federico Dimarco gave Inter the lead after 33 minutes and Romelu Lukaku added the second in the 74th minute. Inzaghi said that his changes reflected the health of his squad. """"Now I have the chance to choose and rotate both in midfield and in attack,"""" he said. Roma also have an eye on Europe. They stayed seventh, five points behind Inter in the last Champions League place, but have another route into that competition if they win the Europa League. Roma host Leverkusen in the first leg of a semi-final on Thursday. Mourinho gathered his players on the field at the final whistle. """"I thanked them for their efforts, the efforts of those who are exhausted, of those who played on one leg, of the one who played with broken ribs or after an injection,"""" he said. """"I go home with great pride. On Thursday we will be there."""" Their neighbours, Lazio stayed second behind newly-crowned champions Napoli but could drop to third if Juventus win away to Atalanta on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, Genoa ensured an immediate return to the top flight when they beat visiting Ascoli 2-1 in Serie B. With two rounds of games left, Genoa moved eight points clear of third-place Bari who drew 1-1 at Modena. Leaders Frosinone, who had secured promotion the previous week, won 3-1 at Pisa. The third promotion place will be determined in a playoff involving six teams. Genoa could replace neighbours Sampdoria who are bottom of Serie A and 10 points from safety. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"AC Milan pay tribute to 'unforgettable' ex-owner Berlusconi | The Daily Star","""AC Milan, the football club which won a host of domestic and European titles under Silvio Berlusconi's ownership, called him """"unforgettable"""" in a tribute after his death aged 86 Monday. """"Thank you, Mr President. Always with us,"""" the club said in a statement, adding it was """"grieving the passing of the unforgettable Silvio Berlusconi"""". """"Tomorrow, we will dream of new ambitions, create new challenges, and seek new victories. Which will represent the good, the strong, and the true that lies inside us, in all of us who shared this adventure of binding our lives to a dream called Milan,"""" the statement continued. Berlusconi reigned supreme at Milan from 1986 until 2017, during which time the club won 29 trophies, including five Champions League and eight Italian league titles. Carlo Ancelotti, who won two Champions League titles as a player for AC Milan in 1989, 1990 before then coaching the club to two more European successes in 2003 and 2007, led the tributes to the former club president. """"Today's sadness doesn't erase the happy moments spent together,"""" Ancelotti, the current Real Madrid manager, tweeted along with a photo of him standing beside Berlusconi. """"There remains infinite gratitude to the president, but above all to an ironic, loyal, intelligent, sincere man, fundamental in my adventure as a football player first, and then as a coach.

"‘I will watch Real-City game with a lot of interest’ | The Daily Star","""Inter Milan manager Simone Inzaghi said he never doubted that his team could reach the Champions League final as they completed a resounding 3-0 aggregate victory over rivals AC Milan on Tuesday. A month ago, Inzaghi faced criticism and was under pressure after a lacklustre run of results, yet his side has turned it around and their 1-0 semi-final second leg win over Milan was their eighth in a row in all competitions. """"It was a dream at the start, but we always believed, we had an extraordinary run and to win the semi-final in a derby this way is immensely satisfying. We can only praise the lads,"""" Inzaghi told Sport Mediaset. Inter are third in Serie A and will face Fiorentina in the Coppa Italia final on May 24. Their return to form has been built on a solid defence, keeping six clean sheets in their current winning streak and conceding only three goals. """"I had said a long while back we would put in a crazy effort without looking at one competition or the other, just trying to achieve our best,"""" he said. Inzaghi basked in the glory of his team's victory over Milan, a fourth successive win over their city rivals. Milan had not suffered four defeats in a single campaign against Inter since the 1973-74 season. """"They showed strength, determination, aggression, concentration, they were wonderful,"""" he said. """"We played four derbies since January and won all four, we know Milan are the Champions of Italy and have huge quality, but the players were excellent and deserve to enjoy this evening."""" Before their two semi-final victories, Inter beat Milan 3-0 to lift the Italian Supercup in January and grabbed a 1-0 win in Serie A the following month. When asked whether he would prefer in the final to face Manchester City or Real Madrid, who play the second leg of their last-four tie on Wednesday, Inzaghi was keeping his cards close to his chest. """"It's normal that when you go to face City or Real you start underdogs, but football is always open: we met Real Madrid last year and we lost two games, but playing well. Manchester City needs no introduction: we will watch and whoever arrives will arrive."""" 'I will watch the game with a lot of interest,' he added. Inzaghi said that Serie A was now the primary focus for his players, who face newly crowned champions Napoli on Sunday. """"I gave the players a day off tomorrow because we haven't had it since April 1. It was deserved, We'll meet again from Thursday because we have to prepare for a league match in Naples.""""

"Derby day puts Milan giants in spotlight | The Daily Star","""Italy's Milan giants face off in Saturday's local derby which pits Serie A's form teams against one another in a match which will give an early indication of their title credentials. The San Siro will host a rematch of last season's Champions League semi-final, a fixture that promises similar fireworks to the two blockbuster clashes in May which went Inter Milan's way. Inter and AC Milan are locked on nine points at the top of the table after perfect starts from both in which summer signings have made an immediate impact. Simone Inzaghi's Inter have scored eight times without conceding in their opening three matches thanks to a strike partnership between Lautaro Martinez and new arrival Marcus Thuram which has brought seven goals. Milan meanwhile have a trio of new signings thrilling fans alongside their established stars, with Tijjani Reijnders and Chelsea old boys Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Cristian Pulisic hitting the ground running. Stefano Pioli has Milan playing an entertaining, fluid style of football boosted by Pulisic's presence on the right wing, which has freed up star man Rafael Leao and given increased service to four-goal Olivier Giroud who should start despite picking up an ankle knock on international duty. """"We've started really well and I know that we'll do all we can,"""" USA forward Pulisic told the Gazzetta Dello Sport. """"We're hopeful for the Scudetto, we've got good players and a great mix of talent. We can win."""" Inter have, Thuram aside, a similar starting XI to the one which lost to Manchester City in Istanbul in June but have quality back up in the likes of Juan Cuadrado and Davide Frattesi. Midfielder Frattesi hasn't started since arriving from Sassuolo but impressed for Italy with a brace against Ukraine on Tuesday night, putting pressure on Inzaghi to pick the 22-year-old. Juventus, two points behind the Milan duo, kick off the weekend's action at home to Lazio rocked by Paul Pogba's provisional suspension for a doping violation. France star Pogba has a potential four-year ban hanging over his head for elevated levels of testosterone after being tested following a match in which he didn't even play. On Thursday a source told AFP that midfielder Pogba has requested examination of the 'B' sample taken during the doping test, and a positive result would reportedly put the 30-year-old at risk of having his contract terminated by Juve. It is yet another destabilising scandal for Juve, who were docked 10 points last season for alleged illicit transfer activity and await a potential, related criminal trial for fraud. A tough week for Juve, who are not accused of any wrongdoing in Pogba's doping violation, got worse with reports that next week's board meeting will confirm a 115 million-euro loss for last season. Juve are also being sued by Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci who confirmed on Thursday legal action over how he was frozen out by Juve, in a manner he considers """"humiliating"""" and against professional football's collective bargaining agreement. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Deadline day upon Europe’s big guns | The Daily Star","""European heavyweights will be on their toes to execute eleventh-hour acquisitions as the summer transfer window for Europe's top five leagues is set to close tonight, from 10pm to 4am (Bangladesh Standard Time). Manchester United appear as front-runners to stay the busiest on the deadline day, despite having made three big-money signings this window: Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta, English midfielder Mason Mount from Chelsea, and Cameroonian goalkeeper Andre Onana from Inter Milan. With Erik ten Hag's squad still seemingly lacking mettle to push for the title race based on three unconvincing displays in the new Premier League season, it is likely that the Red Devils will go all in to rope two players in key positions -- Moroccan midfielder Sofyan Amrabat from Fiorentina on a loan deal and Spanish left-back Marc Cucurella from Chelsea. Fiorentina reportedly have no qualms with the loan transfer, but the Italian side want Manchester United to end up buying the player when his contract ends at season's end. The English powerhouse, however, seem to have an eye on 21-year-old midfielder Ryan Gravenberch from Bayern Munich if the Amrabat deal does not come to fruition but they might have to face stiff competition from Liverpool. The red half of Manchester are not unfamiliar to successful signing of big names, having acquired the services of Wayne Rooney from Everton in 2004 and Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham in 2008, among others. As far as off-loading is concerned, club's former captain Harry Maguire could seal a deal with West Ham while Donny Van de Beek is on both Turkish giants Galatasaray and French club Lorient's radar. Meanwhile in Spain, FC Barcelona reportedly seek to secure two Portuguese players with identical first names in their ranks: full-back Joao Cancelo from reigning European champions Manchester City and forward Joao Felix from Chelsea. Elsewhere, Paris-Saint Germain are set to splurge for French forward Randal Kolo Muani from Eintracht Frankfurt for a whopping 80 million euros. The PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid saga has appeared to have come to a halt, for now at least. As Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti mentioned, Los Blancos have already shut the doors despite multiple persisting injury concerns in the side. However, grating the cheese of Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp, Saudi outfits Al Ittihad are reportedly interested in Egyptian star Mohamed Salah as the Saudi league continues to attract more talents out of Europe with their transfer window set to run till the 20th of this month. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Messi at PSG: Flashes of genius but promise unfulfilled | The Daily Star","""Lionel Messi arrived in France to a hero's welcome, seen as the man who would deliver the Champions League for Paris Saint-Germain. Two years on, the Argentinian is set to depart without having achieved that aim and having only produced his brilliant best in flashes. It is difficult to qualify Messi's time at PSG as a success, even if the move to the French capital helped set him up for the crowning glory of his career at last year's World Cup and did no harm to the Qatar-owned club as a sporting brand. At his unveiling in Paris in August 2021, Messi said winning the Champions League for the fifth time in his career was his """"dream"""" and that he was in """"the ideal place"""" to do it. That was seductive talk for PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi, sat next to him, and for fans of the club who were desperate to see their team win European football's greatest prize for the first time. The previous season they had lost to Manchester City in the semi-finals, having been beaten by Bayern Munich in the 2020 final. Messi looked like the final piece in the jigsaw. However, PSG have gone backwards with Messi. They were beaten in the Champions League last 16 by Real Madrid last season with Mauricio Pochettino in charge and suffered the same fate this year at Bayern's hands with Christophe Galtier on the bench. There must be a reason why Pep Guardiola did not push to bring an ageing Messi to City, despite his former coach at Barcelona often describing him as the best player of all time. Guardiola's side are through to this season's Champions League final and playing at a level PSG could not currently hope to match, despite having Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar in the same side. Having to accommodate those three attacking superstars has weakened PSG overall as a team. Now they must try to build a more balanced side without a player who turns 36 this month and has been costing an estimated annual salary of 30 million euros ($32.1 million) after tax.  From cheers to jeers By early this year Messi was being jeered by some supporters at the Parc des Princes. That was before he skipped training for an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia to fulfil commitments as a tourism ambassador for the Gulf state. A one-week suspension followed, and there was no prospect of Messi signing a new deal in Paris after that. Messi had 32 goals in 74 games for PSG before Saturday's final match this season against Clermont. His first season in France was difficult as he struggled to settle having been uprooted from Barcelona. He has sometimes struggled with the physical nature of the French league, but this season has been more memorable. The seven-time Ballon d'Or winner developed a fine understanding with Mbappe, appearing to accept that the younger French star was the focal point of the team. Messi has scored 16 Ligue 1 goals and set up 16 goals this season, comfortably the most assists of any player in France's top flight. He leaves having added two Ligue 1 title winner's medals to his collection.  Criticism unjustified? After all he won at Barcelona, and his World Cup triumph with Argentina, the French league may not mean that much to Messi when he looks back on his career. As Vincent Duluc noted in France's leading sports daily L'Equipe: """"PSG have not been better than they were before because of him...and he seemed to have as much desire to play in Ligue 1 as he did to go to the dentist."""" Nevertheless, Messi has still left his mark on those who have worked with him and come up against him. He was nominated for this season's French player of the year prize, even if he missed out on the award to Mbappe. """"I have had the privilege to coach the best player in the history of football,"""" said Galtier this week. """"This year he has been an important part of the team. I have never thought that the criticism of him was justified at all, when he is 35 and there is a World Cup in the middle of the season and yet I think he has scored or set up more than 40 goals in all competitions. """"It has been a great privilege not to coach him but to accompany him throughout the season.""""

"Portugal's Ramos signs for PSG | The Daily Star","""Portugal attacker Goncalo Ramos has joined Paris Saint-Germain from Benfica on a one-year loan deal with an option to buy, the French champions announced on Monday. Ramos, 22, came through the Portuguese club's academy and scored 19 league goals in 30 matches last season. At the 2022 World Cup he scored a hat-trick and made an assist in his first international start in the last 16 win over Switzerland. """"It's a big moment of pride and immense joy to join Paris Saint-Germain,"""" Ramos said in a PSG statement. """"PSG are one of the biggest clubs in the world with one of the best squads,"""" he added. Ramos is the Parisians' eighth summer signing after the arrivals of the likes of France defender Lucas Hernandez and Spain attacker Marco Asensio. They missed out on Harry Kane with the England striker being heavily linked with Bayern Munich. PSG open the defence of their Ligue 1 crown by hosting Lorient on Saturday but the start of the campaign is being clouded by questions over Kylian Mbappe's future. The France captain has one year left on his contract with PSG, who want him to leave now rather than for free next summer. Mbappe is refusing to sign a new contract and PSG believe he has already struck a deal to move to Real Madrid next year.

"PSG try to seal Kolo Muani deal on transfer deadline day | The Daily Star","""Paris Saint-Germain were hoping to complete a move for France striker Randal Kolo Muani from Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday in what would be the biggest deal to go through on transfer deadline day in Europe. The 24-year-old forward, who hails from the Paris suburbs, has been a target for PSG all summer and is keen to join the French champions. He missed training with Frankfurt this week, with the German side confirming """"his desire to be transferred to another club before the transfer window ends on Friday evening"""". Kolo Muani, who signed for the Bundesliga club from Nantes only a year ago, played no part in Eintracht's 2-0 home win over Bulgarian side Levski Sofia on Thursday that saw them seal a place in the Europa Conference League group stage. However, up until Friday morning Frankfurt had rejected PSG's proposals for a player who is under contract at his present club until 2027. It is understood that the Ligue 1 side have attempted to offer their out-of-favour forward Hugo Ekitike to Eintracht as part of any deal, as they look to team Kolo Muani up with fellow French internationals Kylian Mbappe and Ousmane Dembele in their attack. Any chances of Mbappe leaving PSG in this transfer window faded after he returned to Luis Enrique's team in August, ending a contract dispute that had dominated headlines all summer in France. Mbappe's contract expires at the end of this season and PSG had previously said the 24-year-old must agree to be sold in the window unless he signed a new deal. """"Kylian is a PSG player. We are having really good discussions with him,"""" club president Nasser al-Khelaifi told broadcaster RMC on Thursday in Monaco after attending the draw for the Champions League group stage. """"He is a magnificent player, as a person and as a professional."""" """"We are going to work on it and try to do something,"""" Khelaifi added, before saying he did not want to talk about Mbappe possibly signing a contract extension. PSG have spent in the region of 250 million euros ($270m) on new signings in this window, including 60 million euros on Uruguay midfielder Manuel Ugarte from Sporting of Portugal. Saudi impact The Qatar-backed club have spent comfortably the most of any club in Europe outside the Premier League since the transfer window opened in June. That is despite Bayern Munich dishing out a Bundesliga record of a reported 100 million euros to sign Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur, having earlier signed centre-back Kim Min-jae from Italian champions Napoli. The other major transfer of the European summer saw Real Madrid spend 103 million euros to sign Jude Bellingham from Borussia Dortmund. As well as the usual drain of talent from the rest of Europe to the far wealthier English Premier League, clubs in major leagues on the continent have also had to deal with the new competition coming from Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Pro League has made headlines with its spending, led by the reported 100 million euros paid to PSG by Al-Hilal of Riyadh for Neymar. Others who have swapped Europe's major leagues for Saudi Arabia include Portugal winger Otavio, who joined Al-Nassr from Porto for a reported 60 million euros. Al-Ittihad of Jeddah signed Brazil midfielder Fabinho from Liverpool for a fee close to 50 million euros, while Al-Ahli paid a similar amount to secure Gabri Veiga from Celta Vigo. The latter move was one of the most ominous indications to the traditionally dominant European leagues that they can no longer expect to stockpile all of the best players. While the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema were past their prime when they opted to move to the Gulf, midfielder Veiga is just 21 and only made his breakthrough in La Liga last season. More big moves from Europe to Saudi could still follow, with the transfer window there open until September 20 according to FIFA. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Mbappe dominates on home return as PSG outclass Lens | The Daily Star","""Kylian Mbappe dominated his first home start of the season, scoring twice as Ligue 1 champions Paris-Saint Germain defeated last season's runners-up Lens, 3-1, on Saturday. In a meeting of two teams winless in their first two league matches, PSG emphatically put their season back on track. The victory lifted them to fourth, two points behind leaders Monaco, who drew on Friday, and Marseille who won earlier Saturday. Mbappe, making his first home start since being reinstated to the team following a contract dispute, posed a threat from the start. In the first half, he had one shot saved by goalkeeper Brice Samba and another cleared off the line by Kevin Danso before Marco Asensio scored his first goal for the club in the 44th minute. PSG's Portuguese midfielder Vitinha surged up the field before moving the ball on to Warren Zaire-Emery who passed to Asensio just outside the box. The Spaniard curled a left foot shot in off the base of the post. Mbappe added a ferocious second after 51 minutes, meeting a return pass from Lucas Hernandez with a first-time side-foot shot from the edge of the box that rocketed past Samba. Mbappe forced another good save from Samba as PSG dominated possession. On a rare Lens counter-attack, Elye Wahi, the club's record signing, who came on after 57 minutes, outpaced the home defence and forced a sprawling save from Gianluigi Donnarumma. Ousmane Dembele, making his first PSG start since moving from Barcelona, lashed an opportunity for a first goal for the club wide. Mbappe added a second in the 90th minute with a shot from near the penalty spot that took two deflections on its way into the net. As PSG's defence relaxed, Wahi forced another flying save from Donnarumma before Morgan Guilavogui scored with the last kick of the match, his shot deflecting in off Milan Skriniar. Earlier, Marseille jumped to second place after ending visiting Brest's winning start to season with a lacklustre 2-0 victory. Knocked out of the Champions League in the third qualifying round by Panathinaikos at the start of the month, Marseille's rebuilt squad had a week to prepare. The hosts started brightly when Chancel Mbemba opened the scoring with a header from Jordan Veretout's impeccable free kick after three minutes. Brest, who had opened the season with two wins, dominated the rest of the half and squandered a string of chances. """"In the first half we weren't organised properly, we lost too many balls and Brest were better,"""" said Marseille coach Marcelino, who took over in the summer. The introduction of Vitinha from the bench lifted Marseille who stretched their lead after 65 minutes. Ismaila Sarr met a cross from Renan Lodi to score for the first time since arriving from Watford in the summer. Vitinha created two golden chances for Veretout and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who was wasteful throughout. """"It got better in the second half and after the second goal, we were the Marseille we want to be,"""" said Marcelino.

"Mbappe calls PSG 'divisive team' | The Daily Star","""Kylian Mbappe has described his club Paris St Germain as a """"divisive team"""", amid a contract standoff between the player and the French Ligue 1 champions. Relations between PSG and Mbappe soured last month after the French forward said he would not renew his contract which expires at the end of next season, meaning he can leave for free in June 2024. If he runs down his contract PSG would be unable to recoup any of the 180 million euros ($197 million) they spent to sign him. PSG President Nasser Al-Khelaifi has said they will not let him go for free. Mbappe, Ligue 1's top scorer in the last five seasons, has been linked with a move to Real Madrid. """"I think that playing for PSG doesn't help much because it's a divisive team, a divisive club,"""" he said in an interview with France Football magazine. He did not elaborate. PSG representatives did not immediately reply when contacted by Reuters for comment on Saturday. PSG have won nine of the last 11 Ligue 1 titles but Mbappe's frustration lies with their performances in the Champions League -- a trophy the Parisian club have never won despite all their investment in the squad. PSG went out in the last 16 this year when they were beaten by Bayern Munich, failing to score in both legs. Mbappe was injured for the first leg and said they were """"helpless"""" in the second. Mbappe said he was the """"most decisive player"""" in the group stage but could not explain what PSG were missing with the club hitting a """"glass ceiling"""" in Europe.

"Mbappe scores on return but PSG held 1-1 by Toulouse | The Daily Star","""Kylian Mbappe scored from the penalty spot 11 minutes into his return for Paris St Germain but the defending champions had to settle for a 1-1 draw at Toulouse in their Ligue 1 clash on Saturday. Mbappe came off the bench to bury a spot-kick he earned just past the hour mark, but Toulouse equalised with a penalty of their own via Zakaria Aboukhlal four minutes from the end. Mbappe was reinstated into PSG's first team after being omitted for their season opening draw with Lorient and frozen out of the main squad for weeks amid an ongoing contract stand-off. Ousmane Dembele also made his debut, following his move from Barcelona, when he was introduced off the bench. The visitors had the ball in the back of the net through 17-year-old midfielder Warren Zaire-Emery early in the second period, but his effort was disallowed for offside. PSG were awarded their penalty on 58 minutes when Rasmus Nicolaisen brought down Mbappe in the box and following a Video Assistant Referee check, the latter buried his spot kick. Toulouse were awarded their penalty as Achraf Hakimi fouled Aboukhlal and the latter got up to earn his side a deserved point. In Saturday's earlier game, new signing Mousa Al-Tamari scored a brace of goals as Montpellier cruised to a 4-1 win at Lyon. Al-Tamari moved to the French south coast from Belgian top-flight side OH Leuven at the start of the season and scored either side of halftime for a dominant Montpellier. The visitors took the lead through Arnaud Nordin on 20 minutes, before Al-Tamari's brace put them in the driving seat. Lyon pulled one back through captain Alexandre Lacazette to give coach Laurent Blanc's side some hope, but when he received a straight red card for a wild kick at Teji Savanier, it quickly faded again. Another new signing, Akor Adams, scored the fourth for Montpellier with his third goal in two games this season. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Mbappe targets scoring record with PSG next season | The Daily Star","""Kylian Mbappe said he has his eyes set on the Ligue 1 record for finishing top scorer in six consecutive seasons next year after he equalled the record for five straight Golden Boot awards set by Jean-Pierre Papin. Mbappe scored his 29th league goal of the season in PSG's final game on Saturday, a 3-2 defeat by Clermont, to finish top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts yet again. The Frenchman was earlier named Ligue 1 player of the season for the fourth time in a row last week. The 24-year-old has finished top scorer in the league every year since his move to PSG was made permanent in 2018, sharing the Golden Boot with AS Monaco's Wissam Ben Yedder in 2019-20. """"My top scorer award? I'm very happy. We've won the championship. I'm still top scorer and top player. So that's great,"""" said Mbappe, who is also PSG's all-time top scorer. """"It's true that it was at the end of the season, when we'd won the title, that it was a personal goal and I've achieved it. """"I'm going down in history and I'm happy. But I still have next year to beat Jean-Pierre Papin."""" Three other players have won the Ligue 1 Golden Boot five times but Papin was the first player to win it five times in a row between 1987 and 1992 when he was with Olympique de Marseille. After vowing to honour his PSG contract, Mbappe's words are another clear indication that he will stay amid rumours of interest from Real Madrid, a club that has courted him in the past but failed to land the French forward. Mbappe signed a contract extension with PSG until 2025 last year, but Sky Sports reported it was only a two-year deal with a player option for a third year - which means Mbappe will be entering the final year of his contract next season. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Messi says he struggled to adapt after PSG move | The Daily Star","""Lionel Messi said he and his family had trouble adapting after his move to Paris St Germain in 2021, and he said the boos and jeers directed at him towards the end of his stint was something team mates Kylian Mbappe and Neymar also endured. The Argentine great did not renew his contract with PSG this month after two years and he announced on June 7 that he will join MLS side Inter Miami, leaving some fans disappointed with his performance. While Messi recorded 32 goals and 35 assists in his two seasons with the French champions, a rift with the fans emerged after he failed to help the team make it past the Champions League last 16 round. """"My stay in Paris started with a very difficult adaptation, much more than I expected, even though I had people I knew in the dressing room.

"PSG in need of reset in future without Messi | The Daily Star","""Now that Paris Saint-Germain have completed the job of retaining the Ligue 1 title, they can focus on the latest rebuilding job in the French capital, where sweeping changes are needed to the faltering Qatari project. PSG's 11th domestic league triumph -– their ninth in the last 11 years -- was secured despite Christophe Galtier's team losing six games in 2023 while nearest challengers Lens have taken most of the plaudits. """"It has not been our best season but it has still been a good one,"""" insisted captain Marquinhos recently. It has been largely forgotten now, given their latest elimination in the Champions League last 16 at the hands of Bayern Munich, but PSG were superb at the start of the campaign. They were unbeaten before the World Cup, when Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar appeared driven by the prospect of the approaching tournament in Qatar. Yet the unravelling that followed was dramatic, with Neymar again cut down by injury and Messi being suspended for missing training after taking an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia. The mood around the club in recent weeks has appeared sullen, with fans disaffected. """"When we take stock, we need to analyse the first half of the season and what state the players were in when they came back from the World Cup,"""" Galtier said on Friday. """"But I understand the disappointment. It has been a very strange season."""" Mbappe front and centre The coaching job has at times seemed too big for Galtier, who arrived last year in the wake of Mbappe's decision to snub Real Madrid and sign a new three-year contract. Mbappe -- scorer of 40 goals this season -- might wonder now if he made the right choice, although the question of his future is bound to come up again soon. According to reports, the 24-year-old's contract will run out next year unless he exercises an option to stay until 2025. However, PSG must now seek to rebuild with Mbappe the focal point more than ever. The ageing and out-of-contract Messi is expected to depart and the physically frail Neymar, now 31, is fading as a force. All eyes will be on what Luis Campos, PSG's Portuguese recruitment guru, does in the transfer market. He is restrained by UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules and by the fact that PSG have an array of unwanted players on big contracts who are set to return after a season on loan. The saving on Messi's annual salary of an estimated 30 million euros ($32.5m) net would provide some leeway. Much has been made of the willingness to focus on younger players hailing from the Paris region, a prolific breeding ground for talent. This, after all, is a club who have been stung by the decision to let so many prospects leave in recent years, from Kingsley Coman and Adrien Rabiot to Moussa Diaby, Christopher Nkunku and Mike Maignan. Galtier on the way out? The holy grail is the Champions League, in which PSG have gone out in the last 16 five times in seven seasons, regularly coming up short at the crucial moment. """"Lots of teams want to go all the way but only one can do so,"""" said Galtier. """"To win the Champions League, or to give yourself a chance, you need to be on form in February and March and we were not."""" PSG have been here before, and Nasser al-Khelaifi, club president since the Qatari takeover of 2011, surely cannot afford to get another rebuild wrong. Qatari interest in buying Manchester United, via Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, has led to questions about the potential impact on PSG. Meanwhile, the club's owners continue to be thwarted in their attempts to buy the Parc des Princes from the city of Paris so they can expand capacity, raising the possibility of a move to the larger Stade de France. All of which means some uncertainty about what lies ahead, although Galtier at least knows his future is likely elsewhere. Under investigation over allegations that he made racist and discriminatory remarks to players when in charge at Nice last season, which he denies, Galtier's authority has diminished over the campaign. A new coach capable of commanding the dressing room's respect is required, and Jose Mourinho and Luis Enrique have been linked with the job. With PSG having gone backwards in two years with Messi, it remains to be seen if the latest rebuild succeeds where past attempts have failed. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

France led by two Kylian Mbappe goals in Amsterdam and beat the depleted Dutch 2-1. Cristiano Ronaldo was another to score twice but Portugal also wobbled with a two-goal lead before beating Slovakia 3-2 in Porto in Group J. In Amsterdam, Mbappe leapt to hook home a volley after seven minutes and then added a second eight minutes into the second half with a sumptuous curler. It was his 42nd international goal, overtaking French legend Michel Platini and putting him fourth in the all-time list.

Goncalo Ramos had opened the scoring for Portugal. Ronaldo then converted a penalty. David Hancko's deflected strike gave Slovakia hope – the first goal Portugal had conceded in qualifying – but Ronaldo soon tapped in a Bruno Fernandes cross.

Mbappe netted a second-half penalty to become the all-time leading French scorer over a season with 54 goals for club and country, beating the mark set by Just Fontaine in 1957-58. It also helped the Paris St Germain forward to move level with Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, who has the chance to finish as top scorer among those playing in the five main European leagues when Norwayface Cyprus on Tuesday.

""""We knew they were a tough nut to crack but we did the job, three points without conceding a goal. Now, straight to holidays."""" Randal Kolo Muani had a clear chance in the 25th minute with a downward header from Mbappe's cross but his attempt went just wide.

After having three penalty claims denied, Les Bleus had another chance to score, only for Jules Kounde's volley to be tipped away by Odysseas Vlachodimos. The hosts were finally awarded a penalty early in the second half after Antoine Griezmann, looking to connect with a cross from the left, was hit in the head by Mavropanos. Vlachodimos parried Mbappe's spot kick but it had to be taken again as the keeper had left his goal line too early. Mbappe found the top corner on his second attempt to score his 40th goal in his 70th international and Greece's hopes were further dashed when Mavropanos picked up a straight red card when he took down Kolo Muani, who was rushing towards goal.

Malta defender Ferdinando Apap turned Bukayo Saka's cross into his own net to give England an early lead, and Trent Alexander-Arnold made it 2-0 with a superb strike. Harry Kane, who became England's all-time top scorer during the last international window in March, made it three goals in three games in this campaign with a penalty to make it 3-0.

An Enis Bardhi penalty and a brilliant curling strike from Napoli's Eljif Elmas had North Macedonia -- who qualified for Euro 2020 -- two goals up. Bournemouth defender Illia Zabarnyi pulled one back for Ukraine just after the hour mark and they then equalised through Yukhym Konoplia. North Macedonia, who visit England on Monday, were reduced to 10 men before Viktor Tsygankov headed in a cross from Chelsea's Mykhailo Mudryk with seven minutes left to complete the comeback.

Perfect Portugal, France closing in Roberto Martinez has enjoyed a serene start as Portugal coach, watching his side plunder 24 goals without reply in a weak Group J. A seventh straight win, against Slovakia on Friday, will see them over the finish line with three games to spare. France are in a similar position with five successive wins in Group B. They can punch their ticket to Germany by defeating the Netherlands again, or by drawing if Greece lose in Dublin. Belgium visit Austria in a meeting of the top two in Group F.

Kazakhstan then go to Finland three days later, Slovenia are away to Northern Ireland, and Denmark will be almost certain to beat San Marino -- losers in all but one of 82 previous Euro qualifiers. Israel bid on hold amid conflict The outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas prompted UEFA to postpone Thursday's match against Group I leaders Switzerland in Tel Aviv. Officials are still assessing whether Israel's game away to Kosovo can go ahead Sunday as scheduled. Israel is reeling under the brutal assault launched by Hamas militants on Saturday in which at least 1,200 people have now been confirmed dead in the worst attack in the country's 75-year history.

England host Italy in Wembley final repeat Gareth Southgate's England hold a six-point cushion in Group C, with reigning champions Italy possessing a game in hand on all other sides. England gained a measure of revenge for their loss on penalties to Italy in the Euro 2020 final, launching their qualifying campaign with a 2-1 win in Naples in March. Ukraine and North Macedonia are level on points with Italy. Those two nations face off Saturday as Italy host Malta. Luciano Spalletti began his tenure as Italy coach with a draw last month in North Macedonia, but victory over Ukraine eased fears of another doomed qualifying campaign after failing to reach the last two World Cups.

"Furry pitch invader steals the show | The Daily Star","""A pitch-invading dog gave ground staff the runaround after the slippery canine stole the ball and charged around the pitch in a Mexican second-tier game between Alebrijes de Oaxaca and Dorados de Sinaloa on Wednesday. Oaxaca beat Dorados 4-0 but the highlight of the match came as the clock hit 90 minutes.

In the game against Wolves, United saw 23 shots attempted at their goal – the most that the Red Devils have faced in a Premier League match at Old Trafford in just under 18 years. André Onana made six saves in keeping a clean sheet on his competitive debut for the club but was lucky not to concede a penalty in injury time following a collision with Wolves' Sasa Kalajdzic. Meanwhile, it will be Spurs' first home game since the departure of England captain Harry Kane to Bayern Munich, with new manager Ange Postecoglou chasing his first Premier League win after a 2-2 draw at Brentford on the opening weekend. The good news for Spurs, however, is that Argentine defender Cristian Romero, who was subbed off after a head knock in their game against Brentford, is fit for today's game. Romero headed Spurs' first Premier League goal of the campaign after 11 minutes at the Community Stadium but was then taken off for suspected concussion. """"Cristian is good to go. Obviously he has been in the hands of the medical team going through all the protocols. He's ticked all the boxes and felt fine all week,"""" Postecoglou told reporters on Friday. """"Aside from that, no change from last week."""" One player that failed to find the net in a Premier League game for Spurs, again, was Richarlison. The pressure is on the Brazilian to perform in front of goal following Kane's departure, and after Sunday's match at Brentford, he's now played 1,096 minutes of Premier League action at Spurs and contributed just a single goal. Richarlison's next goal would be his 50th in the Premier League, but he's only scored once in nine league appearances versus Man Utd, for Everton in April 2019. Meanwhile, the top four last season all won their opening games this term but the Manchester City versus Newcastle clash today ensures the run cannot continue. Newcastle face the first big test of their Premier League title aspirations but the trip to champions Manchester City could be coming at the right time for the table-topping Magpies. The late kick-off at the Etihad will be City's fourth game in two weeks and follows Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup penalty shootout win over Sevilla in the sapping heat and humidity of Athens. Pep Guardiola's side are also without influential Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, ruled out for up to four months after suffering a hamstring injury in the season-opening 3-0 win at Burnley. """"Thank you so much to the Premier League for letting us play on Saturday, and not on Sunday and Monday,"""" Guardiola said sarcastically of the 72-hour turnaround from Wednesday's game. """"Thank you so much"""". Newcastle are meanwhile well-rested and still fizzing after their 5-1 home thrashing of Aston Villa on the opening weekend sent the Saudi-owned side top of the standings on goal difference. Newcastle have yet to win a Premier League match at The Etihad but the arrival of Italy's Sandro Tonali has boosted an already strong midfield featuring Brazil internationals Bruno Guimaraes and Joelinton. Elsewhere, Liverpool are overwhelming favourites to win their first home league game of the season against Bournemouth on Saturday, a side they thumped 9-0 at Anfield last August to equal the Premier League record. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Pochettino urges Chelsea to be more clinical in front of goal | The Daily Star","""Chelsea are doing everything you would expect from a top-four team except finding the back of the net, manager Mauricio Pochettino said on Friday. Despite spending more than any other club in Europe in the close season, Chelsea are 14th in the Premier League with five points from five games having scored only five goals. Pochettino said he was not frustrated as the London club have 12 players sidelined with injury but that they probably deserved more points. """"We need to be more clinical in front of goal and convert chances into goals. That is the most important thing,"""" Pochettino told reporters ahead of Sunday's home game against Aston Villa. """"In all the data we are in the top four. But in front of goal, we are in the bottom and that is why we don't have the points that we deserve. Football is about winning games. """"I am disappointed because I think many teams with less score more. That is why we feel bad, the players deserve more. The only way to find what we want is to keep pushing, keep playing."""" Chelsea did not qualify to play in any European competition this season and Pochettino said that had given the squad time to recover. """"It has been good to recover players from the international break. The circumstances have given us time to work and we've had a really good week,"""" he said. """"It's a time that, of course, for the fans is difficult because they are used to being in Europe but we need to take advantage of the situation."""" Pochettino said record signing Moises Caicedo is training after returning from a knee injury but he would be assessed on Saturday while Marc Cucurella has recovered from a fever. He also said Chelsea's 22-year-old forward Armando Broja has fully recovered from an anterior cruciate ligament surgery and could be involved over the weekend. """"It's after nine months of not competing, we cannot put responsibility on him,"""" the Argentine boss said. """"The responsibility must be on the team and the collective effort.

"Chelsea crisis: Is time already running out for Pochettino? | The Daily Star","""Mauricio Pochettino has pleaded for more time as he scrambles for solutions to Chelsea's mounting crisis. But how patient will the owners be? The Blues, European champions only two years ago, are a lowly 14th in the Premier League table, just four points above the relegation zone, after one win in their first six matches. Their latest setback was a 1-0 defeat against Aston Villa on Sunday, with Ollie Watkins scoring the winner after the dismissal of Chelsea defender Malo Gusto. Last year, Chelsea mustered their lowest points tally of the Premier League era but they have made an even more dire start to the current campaign. """"Give me time,"""" Pochettino pleaded after Sunday's match, urging the club's American owners to back him. """"They (the owners) are disappointed, they arrived at the club and are so excited to build a project. """"Of course they feel disappointed but at the same time they need to support the plan."""" Pochettino was confirmed as the new man in the Stamford Bridge hot seat in May -- becoming the third permanent boss since Todd Boehly's consortium bought the west London club from Roman Abramovich in 2022. Chelsea hailed the Argentine as a """"winning coach, who has worked at the highest levels"""". Boehly backed his manager by bankrolling another huge spending spree during the summer transfer window, taking Chelsea's outlay on new players in just over a year beyond £1 billion ($1.2 billion). But the return on their investment has been pitiful during a period of churn and upheaval on and off the pitch. Goal-shy Chelsea Chelsea have mustered just five goals in their first six league matches -- and three of those came in the 3-0 win against newly promoted Luton. They have failed to score in 13 Premier League matches in 2023 -- more than any other side. The frustrated Pochettino bemoaned his team's lack of luck in the Villa defeat, saying the only thing missing was goals. """"We need to be aware about what is going on but in some way we need to be calm because the team is creating, the team is alive, the team is fighting every single action,"""" he said. Pochettino can point to a lengthy injury list as a partial explanation for Chelsea's blunt attack. He lost France forward Christopher Nkunku to a serious knee injury in a pre-season friendly, but others including Mykhailo Mudryk, Nicolas Jackson, Raheem Sterling and Cole Palmer have failed to deliver. The former Tottenham and Paris Saint-Germain boss will be painfully aware that Chelsea are not a patient club -- the hire-and-fire culture of the Abramovich era persists under Boehly's leadership. Chelsea sacked Thomas Tuchel in the early weeks of last season, and Graham Potter suffered the same fate in April, axed after less than seven months in charge when the club were 11th in the table. Pochettino enhanced his reputation during his five-year stint at Tottenham, subsequently taking charge at PSG, where he won the Ligue 1 title. However, he failed to meet PSG's primary goal of winning the Champions League, leaving his managerial CV still relatively light on silverware compared with some of his Premier League counterparts. Next up for Chelsea are in-form Brighton, who travel to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday for a League Cup third round tie. They then face local rivals Fulham in the Premier League, with matches looming against Arsenal, Tottenham and champions Manchester City. The Villa fans delighted in the discomfort of the Chelsea boss at the weekend, chanting that he would be """"sacked in the morning"""".

"Fernandes eases pressure on United with winner at Burnley | The Daily Star","""Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes struck a sublime volley to earn a 1-0 victory at Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday as Erik ten Hag's side ended a three-match losing streak in all competitions. The Portuguese got on the end of a pinpoint Jonny Evans pass on the stroke of halftime to dispatch a first-time finish past Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford. Evans had already had a goal disallowed for United although Burnley had plenty of chances of their own and were unfortunate to be behind at the interval. The visitors were more comfortable after the break with Burnley's patient football unable to create clear-cut chances. United's third victory of the season lifted them into eighth place in the standings with nine points from six games. Burnley have one point from five games and are bottom on goal difference. After consecutive league defeats by Arsenal and Brighton & Hove Albion and Wednesday's high-scoring reverse at Bayern Munich, the pressure has been mounting on Ten Hag. But when he needed his skipper to lead by example, Fernandes provided the moment of quality to get United back on track. Evans, whose earlier header was ruled out for offside after a VAR check, floated the perfect pass forward over Burnley's defence and as the ball dropped, Fernandes belted a right-foot volley that flashed into the net. It was a superb moment for the 35-year-old Evans who returned to the club on a one-year deal in the close season and was making his first start for United since 2015. """"This club, if you're not winning games you're going to be under fire,"""" Evans told TNT Sports. """"Some of the young players haven't experienced that but I hope that I can come in and add some calmness. Hopefully this can kickstart something for us."""" Manager Ten Hag said his side had shown great team spirit and United certainly needed to be resolute to weather some intense Burnley pressure early on. United keeper Andre Onana, whose mistake proved costly at Bayern in midweek, made a superb early save to keep out Zeki Amdouni's header. Amdouni then looked poised to score from Aaron Ramsey's pass but his shot struck the far post. United's luck looked out when Evans had his header from Sergio Reguilon's delivery ruled out for offside. But Fernandes answered the call to send the away fans back home with smiles on their faces. """"We know that we have been in a tough bit of momentum but we knew we could come back from it,"""" Fernandes said. """"Obviously today the performance was not the best but we got the three points which is the most important thing."""" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"Wolves end Man City's perfect start with shock win | The Daily Star","""Hwang Hee-chan scored the winner as Wolverhampton Wanderers ended champions Manchester City's perfect start to the Premier League season with a shock 2-1 home win on Saturday. The defeat at Molineux was City's second loss in five days, after Newcastle United dumped them out of the League Cup, and dashed the leaders' hopes of stretching their season-opening run to seven league wins in a row. A Ruben Dias own goal sent Wolves 1-0 up in the 13th minute, Pedro Neto's shot deflected in off the Portuguese player's knee, but Julian Alvarez levelled the score with a bending free kick in the 58th. Hwang restored the home side's lead against the run of play in the 66th by firing into the back of the net after a pass from Matheus Cunha. With City manager Pep Guardiola serving a touchline ban for his third yellow card of the season, the visitors looked distinctly average against determined and hard-working opponents. Matheus Nunes, who joined City from Wolves at the end of the transfer window after forcing a move by refusing to train, started and was booed by the crowd every time he touched the ball.

The 32-year-old endured an injury-plagued spell at Real Madrid after his 89-million-pound (103 million euros, $110 million) move from Chelsea in 2019, playing just 76 matches in all competitions across four seasons. """"You must listen to yourself and say stop at the right time,"""" Hazard wrote on Instagram. """"After 16 years and more than 700 matches played, I have decided to end my career as a professional footballer."""" Hazard had a far happier time at Chelsea, winning both the Premier League title and Europa League twice as well as the FA and League Cup from 2012-2019. He was also integral to Belgium's impressive run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, beating Brazil in the quarter-finals but bowing out to eventual champions France in the semi-final. However, he was unable to rouse himself for last year's World Cup finals when along with fellow stars Kevin de Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, Hazard and a below-par Belgium bowed out in the group stage. Nevertheless Hazard -- who also won a Ligue 1 crown with Lille and two La Liga titles with Real and picked up a Champions League winners' medal as an unused substitute in 2022 -- was in grateful mood as he signed off. """"I was able to realise my dream, I have played and had fun on many pitches around the world,"""" he said. """"During my career I was lucky to meet great managers, coaches and teammates -- thank you to everyone for these great times, I will miss you all.""""

"Hazard linked with Chelsea for possible return | The Daily Star","""Although the story seems to crop up every transfer window, the reactions, feelings and emotions change like the wind. Just the thought of seeing a Chelsea icon back in the royal blue at Stamford Bridge is enough to get the fans excited. Todd Boehly is already closing in on a triple deal as Chelsea prepare to announce Raheem Sterling, Kalidou Koulibaly becomes their big-name centre back target, and Nathan Ake makes his own return to the club, but no feeling comes as close to butterflies in the stomach as a loved player returning back to his spiritual home. This trio almost certainly won't be it for the incomings, let alone the endless possibilities with players leaving the club this summer as well. It promised to be busy as soon as Boehly and Clearlake were announced as the new owners, and it hasn't disappointed so far. One thing they haven't managed to change from the Roman Abramovich transfer saga log is the return of a king. Just like it felt that Eden Hazard was forever being linked with a move away from SW6 as soon as he signed for Chelsea in 2012, the Belgian is equally as drawn to a dramatic return back to London each window as well. Almost undoubtedly the Blues best signing under Abramovich in the last 10 years, Hazard left the club in 2019 after his best-ever season, and the deal to take him to Spain, which was inevitable given his dream to play for Real Madrid, was worth over £100m. That was ultimately the parting gift of Marina Granovskaia, as Hazard has missed more than 50 matches over three years in Madrid already due a string of injuries. The Belgian has also been reported as being unhappy in Spain and is commonly linked with a move away from the club. That time has come once again. Spanish journalist Sergio Santos has said on Twitter, """"Hazard is on the market. Despite his improvement in recent months, Madrid will make it easy for him to leave if any club shows interest. Ancelotti will try to recover his best version if he stays... but he has given the OK to his sale if offers arrive."""" Hazard didn't get onto the pitch for in Madrid's Champions League final victory over Liverpool, nor did he play a minute of either quarter-final leg against Chelsea earlier in the campaign due to injury. He managed just 83 minutes in the European competition in total and couldn't register a single league goal either. Although the thought of Hazard coming back to Chelsea is appealing for nostalgic purposes, unless there is a major and unexpected revival, he wouldn't be able to add the same impact that Thomas Tuchel needs from his attackers and would only clog up the wage bill. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

"Ruthless Arsenal heap more misery on Bournemouth | The Daily Star","""Arsenal maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 4-0 win at struggling Bournemouth on Saturday as Kai Havertz opened his account for the London club and Bukayo Saka, Martin Odegaard and Ben White also scored. Mikel Arteta's Arsenal climbed to second in the table with 17 points, one behind champions Manchester City who lost away at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Meanwhile, Andoni Iraola's winless Bournemouth side dropped into the relegation zone and sit 18th with three points from seven games. Arteta and Iraola are no strangers to each other having played together for youth side Antiguoko in the Basque Country three decades ago, but it was the Arsenal boss who came out on top in a one-sided contest. Bournemouth showed promise in the early stages as they pegged Arsenal back in their own half, but the visitors made the breakthrough in the 17th minute when Odegaard unlocked the defence with a sublime cross to the back post. Gabriel Jesus, playing on the wing, attempted to power his header home from a tight angle but the Brazilian's effort came off the post and fell to Saka who headed into an empty net. Odegaard doubled Arsenal's lead from the penalty spot just before halftime after Max Aarons fouled Eddie Nketiah. The Norwegian calmly sent Neto the wrong way with a low effort into the bottom corner. Bournemouth panicked and six minutes after the restart, Odegaard won Arsenal a second penalty when he was upended by a rash tackle from Ryan Christie. But Saka and Odegaard, the club's primary penalty takers, handed the ball to Havertz, who put his effort away with aplomb to lift a huge burden off the shoulders of the 65 million-pound ($79.28 million) signing. A deflated Bournemouth were down and out and though Neto denied Emile Smith Rowe twice, he could do nothing in added time when White completed the rout after glancing a header into the net. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """
"City remain the team to beat | The Daily Star","""Defending champions Manchester City will be gunning for their 8th Premier League title as they fixate to build following their coveted treble-winning season. Pep Guardiola's side became only the second English club to win a treble after city rivals Manchester United achieved the feat in the 1998-99 season. United backed it up by clinching the league the following season, and all eyes this time would very naturally be on City to do the same. However, Guardiola's task has become stiffer as potential candidates who would look to challenge the reigning European champions have all brought in significant reinforcements to help their cause as the 2023-24 season has just got underway. Arsenal, who pushed City to the limit last season in the league, won the curtain-raiser of the season, the Community Shield, on August 6 to bring Mikel Arteta only his second win against Guardiola's City in 10 meetings. City have rarely had to rely on other sides for their destiny as they have consistently managed to churn out success with fluid football but they also have an interesting record to help them envision lifting another league title. In the last decade, no side other than themselves have won the league after clinching the Community Shield! City were the ones to do it in the 2018-19 season. Guardiola, in an interview previously, credited a big part of his success to his mentality of upgrading or bringing in fresh players to the side after a successful season. """"When did you see me with the same squad after winning the league?"""" Pep had asked. With club captain Ilkay Gundogan and winger Riyad Mahrez having left, City have brought in Chelsea's Mateo Kovacic and defender Josko Gvardiol from RB Leipzig as reinforcements and upgrades, with potentially more coming in. Despite Arsenal being the only real contender last time around, City turned around a five-point deficit and clinched the crown but they are set to have at least a few more teams, who look the part to pose a serious challenge to Pep Guardiola this time around. Arsenal have made serious reinforcements to their side too, making their intentions clear with a statement signing when they roped in West Ham captain Declan Rice for 105 million pounds after getting the signature of Kai Havertz from London rivals Chelsea. With the new-found belief of actually being able to compete against City for the Premier League title, Arteta's Arsenal have gained that attitude adjustment and would look to go for the title with a much more refined group, not just a young, talented bunch. Rivals Chelsea were eagerly waiting for the transfer window to begin after a mishap of a season that saw them being managed by four different managers. The Blues cashed in big time on the window as they staged a squad overhaul where they let go of as many as 17 players, with 13 of those being permanent offloads as owner Todd Boehly takes a second chance to get their new beginning off to a less tumultuous start. However, the one position that has haunted The Blues over the years -- the number nine curse -- is yet again at the forefront as French striker Christopher Nkunku was ruled out owing to a knee injury leaving Nicolas Jackson with the onus of leading the line. As shirt numbers were revealed last Tuesday, it was evident that no one wanted to even try spurning the curse as all forwards snubbed the number nine shirt! A young side, with a new manager in Mauricio Pochettino, Chelsea's primary objective this season has to be to get back to competing with Europe's best. Another side that has been crying out for a striker has finally managed to land one ahead of the new season. Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag's demands were met when Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund was brought in as United's most expensive signing of the summer so far. Ten Hag's struggles to instil his ideology and system have been evident throughout last season as the Red Devils try to work out the puzzle to get back to their former glories with the resources they have. One of the biggest resurgences of the 2022-23 was Eddie Howe's Newcastle, who maintained remarkable consistency to cement a place in Europe after an absence of almost two decades. With both feet on the ground, Newcastle have remained measured so far in the market, with an exception in the form of signing Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali for 55 million pounds followed by Leicester City's Harvey Barnes for 44 million pounds. These signings, however impressive, infer their desire to solidify a top-six finish in the Premier League. Liverpool's fall from grace saw the Merseyside team make a shuffle in terms of recruitment. A handful of outgoings have made way for some new, exciting incomings -- World Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai.

"Man Utd dismiss Palace in League Cup | The Daily Star","""Manchester United kept the critics at bay as they cruised into the League Cup fourth round with a 3-0 win against Crystal Palace on Tuesday. United boss Erik ten Hag and his players have been under fire after a disappointing start to the season. But, following Saturday's narrow Premier League victory at Burnley, they secured a second successive win to ease the pressure at least a little. Alejandro Garnacho put them ahead in the first half and Casemiro doubled the lead before the interval, with Anthony Martial sealing the victory after the break. When United lifted the League Cup in February to end a six-year trophy drought, it was seen as the start of a new era of success at Old Trafford. Instead, United have been engulfed by a series of problems on and off the pitch. Having lost three of their first five league games to severely damage their title hopes, Ten Hag was under mounting scrutiny until the last four days offered a ray of hope. """"It is a good night. I think we played quite well and we dominated the game. That was what we were looking for,"""" Ten Hag said after his gamble to make seven changes paid off. """"We made a step forward at Burnley with how we defend and today, on the ball, we make another step. There is still a lot to come."""" Dean Henderson was making his Palace debut after leaving United a month ago, but the keeper's return lasted just 19 minutes before he limped off injured. Henderson's replacement Sam Johnstone had to pick the ball out of the net moments after coming on as United took a 21st-minute lead. Diogo Dalot's cross arrowed towards Garnacho and the Argentine winger swivelled to fire a low strike past Johnstone from 10 yards. Casemiro increased United's advantage six minutes later, climbing highest to meet Mason Mount's corner with a glancing header that gave Johnstone no chance. United's third arrived in the 55th minute when Martial rifled home from Casemiro's cross. Giving further encouragement to Ten Hag, Morocco's Sofyan Amrabat impressed on his first start since his deadline-day loan switch from Fiorentina. Amrabat lined up in a stand-in left-back role before switching to his preferred central midfield position after half-time. """"I told the manager I will play where he needs me, even if it's goalkeeper!"""" Amrabat said. United will look to extend their winning run when Palace return to Old Trafford in the league on Saturday. Luton rocked Luton's difficult start to the season hit a new low with a shock 1-0 defeat at third-tier Exeter. Luton enjoyed a fairytale promotion to the Premier League last season, but they are winless after five games in the top flight. Rob Edwards' decision to make 10 changes backfired as Demetri Mitchell bagged Exeter's 83rd-minute winner with a close-range finish before he was sent off in the final moments. """"It was a disappointing night for us clearly. We need to be better, more aggressive, and have more desire to create chances. And, when we do, be more ruthless,"""" Edwards said. Wolves were the other Premier League side to suffer an embarrassing exit as they blew a two-goal lead in a 3-2 defeat at Ipswich. Gary O'Neil made 10 changes against the Championship high-flyers and his understudies raced ahead thanks to goals from Hwang Hee-chan and Toti Gomes in the first 15 minutes. But Omari Hutchinson, on loan from Chelsea, got one back in the 28th minute and Freddie Ladapo levelled seven minutes before half-time. Ipswich completed their comeback in the 58th minute when Jack Taylor blasted in from 25 yards. Salford -- the fourth-tier club owned by former Manchester United stars including David Beckham and Gary Neville -- were thrashed 4-0 by Burnley. Off to a winless start in the Premier League, Burnley boss Vincent Kompany made 11 changes, with Sander Berge, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Dara O'Shea and Wilson Odobert all scoring. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

He had been due to stand trial on Nov. 27, 2023, but all criminal charges against him were dropped in February.

Not since the 1989/90 season have United lost four of the first seven league games of the season. Joachim Andersen's first-half goal for Palace inflicted that fate on Ten Hag's men, who were booed off by the Old Trafford crowd at full-time. """"I can give you reasons but you will explain it as an excuse and there are no excuses, we have to win,"""" said Ten Hag. """"We have to be more consistent, this is not the demand for Man Utd.

""""We have to show it in our body language that Old Trafford is a fortress and you can't get anything here."""" Despite having 19 shots on goal, United suffered from a familiar lack of cutting edge in the final third. Bruno Fernandes, Rasmus Hojlund and Mason Mount were all guilty of missing chances.

Ten Hag has hinted it was not the only incident involving Sancho that was taken into consideration when deciding the punishment.

Tomorrow we have a big game, we are going into a new block of games, many games in a condensed programme. I focus on that."""" Sancho was linked with a move to Saudi Arabia before the transfer deadline but will now remain a United player at least until the window reopens in January.

"Dortmund down Bayern to win German Super Cup | The Daily Star","""English winger Jadon Sancho starred for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday to help his side beat rivals Bayern Munich 2-0 to win their sixth DFL Super Cup and claim early bragging rights in the curtain raiser for the German Bundesliga. The teenager was the key man, assisting one goal and scoring the other in front of the Dortmund faithful against a Bayern side looking a little lost without departed greats Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. Lucien Favre's side tailed off in last season's title challenge, finishing runners-up to Bayern who clinched a record 29th league trophy and the DFB Pokal. However, they showed their determination to put that right, captain Marco Reus forcing a diving save from Manuel Neuer in the very first minute. Neuer was then lucky to not be beaten or force the referee to show him a red card when he ran out halfway into his own half after 15 minutes to dive at Paco Alcacer who knocked the ball past the goalkeeper, but it trickled past the open goal. Alcacer made amends for his miss shortly after halftime. Sancho dazzled the opposition with his footwork on the right before teeing up the Spanish striker on the edge of the box who found the bottom right corner. Some last ditch defending stopped Bayern from equalising 10 minutes later, with Kingsley Coman, Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski all denied from close range in a matter of seconds. But it was Sancho who stole the show, doubling Dortmund's lead after collecting the ball and sprinting from almost the halfway line to slot it expertly past Neuer. Bayern tried to find openings but were unable to find a way past a stubborn yellow wall, which will this season feature Mats Hummels after his return from Munich. The veteran defender was not able to face his former side due to a knock in training. For Niko Kovac's men, the result was a reminder that they have areas in their squad to improve and they will no doubt increase their efforts to land young winger and long term target Leroy Sane from Manchester City. Dortmund, meanwhile, go some way to make up for their 5-0 capitulation to Bayern in April and go into the new Bundesliga season buoyed by winning the first silverware of the campaign. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Choupo-Moting, who featured for PSG in their 1-0 Champions League final loss to Bayern in Lisbon in 2020, sidefooted the ball home after Thomas Mueller dispossessed Marco Verratti inside his own penalty area. Substitute Serge Gnabry scored in the last minute of regular time to wrap a 3-0 aggregate victory for the six-time European champions. Bayern reached the last eight for the fourth straight year, while PSG will need to wait at least another season to lift the coveted trophy for the first time. The best chance of a tight opening half fell to PSG's Vitinha, who won the ball when Bayern goalkeeper Yann Sommer attempted to dribble out of a busy penalty area. Vitinha was presented with an empty goal, but his rolled effort allowed Matthijs de Ligt to clear the ball off the line. Bayern roared out of the blocks after half-time, but PSG were let off by the clumsy feet of Choupo-Moting, who tripped before shooting and then stood in the way of a goal-bound effort from Joshua Kimmich. The Cameroon striker looked to have redeemed himself in the 52nd minute, but his header from a curling Jamal Musiala cross was chalked off for offside against Mueller. Bayern continued to push and PSG's dam broke on 61 minutes, with Choupo-Moting doing the damage.

"Arsenal make statement with long-awaited win over City | The Daily Star","""Mikel Arteta believes Arsenal have broken a significant barrier in their bid to win the Premier League after Gabriel Martinelli's late goal sealed a cathartic 1-0 victory against Manchester City. Arteta's side had lost their previous 12 league meetings with City before Martinelli's 86th minute strike deflected off Nathan Ake to spark wild celebrations at the Emirates Stadium. For the first time since December 2015, the Gunners could savour a victory over City and they embraced the moment amid jubilant scenes on the pitch and among the 60,000 sell-out crowd. Arsenal had already beaten City on penalties in the Community Shield at Wembley in August, a success they celebrated with almost as much vigour as Sunday's. But this was a far more important result, coming not in a glorified friendly but in the red-hot atmosphere of a crucial clash between the champions and their closest rivals last season. Arsenal held an eight-point lead at the top of the table in April, only to collapse in the final furlong as City lifted a third successive title en route to an incredible treble. Rather than let the pain from that meltdown break them, Arteta and his players are using it as fuel to land the club's first title in 20 years. It was instructive to see Arsenal tigerishly push City back in the closing stages of the second half as they searched for a winner with the champions appearing content with a point. Arsenal's hunger was rewarded and Arteta is convinced it could be a defining moment in their development. """"It's a great feeling. You could sense it. It's been so many years without beating them, but now we have beaten the best team in the world without a question of doubt,"""" he said.

The bitter memories of 15 league games without a win over City can be consigned to history as Arsenal showed they can go toe to toe with Guardiola's star-studded team. They restricted City to only four shots and never let the visitors establish their trademark passing and movement. """"City are constantly asking you questions, they threaten you in certain areas.

The Spaniard missed each of City's recent defeats and, tellingly, they won when he was available for the midweek Champions League tie against Leipzig. """"That is a stat. We cannot deny it. We put players to control more passes but Arsenal are aggressive in these areas,"""" Guardiola said. """"Rodri is an important player but he is not there for the reason everyone knows.""""

"Martinez hits four in Inter rout as Milan see off Lazio | The Daily Star","""Lautaro Martinez scored all four goals as Inter Milan thrashed Salernitana 4-0 on Saturday to stay top in Serie A, while AC Milan kept pace with their city rivals after overcoming Lazio. Inter rebounded from their first loss of the season midweek against Sassuolo thanks to a sensational second-half display from Martinez. The Argentina striker dinked Marcus Thuram's superb ball over home goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa to break the deadlock just past the hour. Salernitana's Mateusz Legowski had a goal disallowed for offside before Martinez drilled in his second from a cross from Nicolo Barella. Martinez completed his hat-trick on 85 minutes after from the penalty spot Thuram was bundled to the ground. He added another with a first-time finish from Carlos Augusto's pass. """"I'm happy because I helped the team, it's all that counts. It was important to win after all the criticism aimed at us after our defeat on Wednesday,"""" said Martinez, who tops the Serie A scoring charts with nine goals. """"I'm not thinking about the title for top scorer, I just want to help the team."""" Inter are level on 18 points with Milan, who had briefly gone top earlier in the day after they overcame a struggling Lazio 2-0. Christian Pulisic gave Milan the lead on the hour at the San Siro when he slammed in a bobbling pass from Rafael Leao for his third goal since joining from Chelsea. Leao was again involved as Milan made sure of the points in the 88th minute, the Portugal winger bursting into the area before cutting the ball back for Noah Okafor to slide home. """"I thought we put a lot of pressure on, it was just a matter of time, we finally opened it up and from there it was a really strong performance,"""" Pulisic told DAZN. """"I haven't been here a long time, there are a lot of new players, but we are really starting to gel well. I am really enjoying my time with the team."""" France goalkeeper Mike Maignan returned for Milan after missing the past two games with a thigh injury he sustained in a goalless draw against Newcastle in the Champions League. Lazio suffered their fourth defeat of the season and dropped to 14th place, with just seven points from as many matches. - Osimhen on target - Napoli secured their second victory in four days as Victor Osimhen came off the bench and scored in a 4-0 win at Lecce, bumping the Italian champions up to third. After a run of three games without a win, Rudi Garcia's side have rediscovered some form heading into next week's Champions League clash at home to Real Madrid. Centre-back Leo Ostigard headed Napoli ahead early on with his first league goal for the club, but it wasn't until the half-time introduction of Osimhen that the visitors took control of the game. The Nigerian nodded in a cross from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia on 51 minutes before late goals from Gianluca Gaetano and Matteo Politano sealed the rout. Politano struck from the spot as Osimhen left penalty duties to a team-mate for the second game running after the club posted a video online mocking him for a missed attempt. After the player's agent threatened legal action this week, Napoli said they never meant to offend Osimhen. Napoli remain four points adrift of Inter and Milan. """"It was a well-managed match from start to finish, we wanted to hit hard and score in the first 15 minutes,"""" said Garcia. """"I'm happy for Ostigard who is really a player who's constantly thinking about the team.""""

"Inter dish out derby destruction, Napoli stutter at Genoa | The Daily Star","""Inter Milan laid down an early title marker on Saturday by handing out a 5-1 derby hammering to AC Milan and going it alone at the Serie A summit, while champions Napoli were held 2-2 at promoted Genoa. Four wins from their opening four matches have Inter leading the pack with a perfect 12 points, two ahead of their other fierce rivals Juventus who beat Lazio 3-1 in the day's early match. Milan sit a further point back in third after a humiliating first defeat of the season before they welcome Newcastle United in the Champions League on Tuesday. Spurred on by the majority of a heaving and raucous San Siro crowd, Inter claimed their fifth straight derby win in all competitions thanks to a Henrikh Mkhitaryan brace, Marcus Thuram's rocket and two late strikes from Hakan Calhanoglu and Davide Frattesi. Simone Inzaghi's side claimed the points with a display which showed why they got past Milan to reach last season's Champions League final and confirmed their status as early favourites to beat their local rivals to a 20th Scudetto. """"We've started the season brilliantly and we want to keep going,"""" Mkhitaryan told DAZN. """"We're all here for the same goal, and I don't care who plays... the coach will pick whoever gives their all for the second star (on the shirt for 20 titles)."""" Thuram continued his fast start in an Inter shirt, the new man also crucial to Mkhitaryan's fifth-minute opener. Inter smash Milan France forward Thuram bundled past Malick Thiaw before finding Federico Dimarco whose mishit shot was guided home by the former Armenia midfielder. And Thuram then underlined Inter's superiority seven minutes before the break after a lightning breakaway started by Lautaro Martinez, collecting from Denzel Dumfries before cutting inside the hapless Thiaw and crashing in an unstoppable shot from the edge of the area. The match looked dead and buried with 45 minutes to play but Rafael Leao halved the deficit in the 57th minute when he rolled in his second of the season after being brilliantly put through by Olivier Giroud. Leao's finish was the first goal conceded by Inter this term and as a violent downpour descended on the San Siro, Mkhitaryan silenced Milan's loud """"away"""" support with his deflected second of the evening after being fed by Martinez. Calhanoglu's 79th-minute penalty and a neat stoppage-time finish from Frattesi, fresh from Tuesday's double for Italy at the same ground, rubbed salt into wounds for Milan and coach Stefano Pioli. """"I don't think we need to apologise to our fans. Do you think we wanted to concede five goals to Inter?"""" said a defiant Pioli who in 2023 has lost every Milan derby to an aggregate score of 12-1. """"We're disappointed, but you ask for forgiveness when you deliberately don't do something."""" Napoli salvage point Napoli's title defence continued to stutter at Genoa where the champions came back from two goals down to snatch a point late on. Rudi Garcia's side, beaten by Lazio before the international break, trail Inter by five points following the draw at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris which came thanks to strikes in the final 15 minutes from Italy internationals Giacomo Raspadori and Matteo Politano. """"We've got work to do, but we had very little time to prepare for this match because a lot of players only came back (from international duty) yesterday,"""" said Politano to Sky Sport in Italy. Mattia Bani headed Genoa into the lead five minutes before the break before Italy striker Mateo Retegui swept in the hosts' second from Kevin Strootman's pass in the 56th minute. Retegui has scored twice since signing from Boca Juniors in July and Saturday's strike looked likely to give Genoa a stunning second win of the campaign. But Napoli didn't give up and were back in it when Raspadori arrowed in his first goal of the season in the 76th minute. And Politano salvaged a draw for Napoli with six minutes remaining with a brilliant volley from Piotr Zielinski's lofted pass. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

Belgium forward Lukaku rolled in Roma's sixth in the 82nd minute of a dominating performance in which talisman Paulo Dybala also got off the mark for the season with a brace. Strikes from Renato Sanches, Bryan Cristante and Gianluca Mancini, as well as a comical Albert Grassi own goal ensured a rout against pointless, goalless and rock-bottom Empoli which moved Roma out of the relegation zone and up to 12th on four points. """"It's obviously important for strikers to score goals,"""" said coach Jose Mourinho to DAZN. """"It was perfect for him as he scores in front his fans and he leaves the field happy. """"He needs to feel loved and wanted. He's come here and he felt immediately that the team needed him."""" Lukaku made his first start alongside Dybala in an attack built to help Roma qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2018. On loan from Chelsea, Lukaku made a substitute appearance in Roma's loss to AC Milan before the international break and had a largely low key evening against Empoli apart from his simple finish from Andrea Belotti's pass. Only 35 seconds had passed when Sebastian Walukiewicz handled Rasmus Kristensen's cross. Dybala to rammed home his first goal of the campaign from the penalty spot. Kristensen was key again when Sanches doubled the hosts' lead in the eighth minute, swinging in another cross from which the unmarked Portugal international guided home a perfect header. Lukaku was involved in Roma's bizarre third, laying off to Cristante before Bartosz Bereszynski whacked the ball off his Empoli teammate Grassi and watched the ball drift into his own goal. Dybala netted his sublime second 10 minutes after the break when he collected Cristante's pass, sent Sebastiano Luperto packing with a feint and rolled in a cool finish. Lukaku on target The Argentina forward would have ended the night with a hat-trick had his free-kick not thwacked the crossbar moments before he was substituted in the 64th minute. The match seemed to be rolling towards an otherwise uneventful end but Cristante started a late flurry in the 79th minute when he drove home Roma's fifth from long range. The stage was set for Lukaku to lap up the applause of fans who swamped an airport to greet his arrival in Rome last month. A Mancini header wrapped up the scoring with four minutes remaining. Christian Kouame shot Fiorentina to a 3-2 win over Atalanta with the decisive strike in Sunday's entertaining Serie A clash in Florence. Ivorian Kouame pounced on defensive indecisiveness in the 76th minute to prod home his first goal of the season and move Fiorentina up to seventh. Giacomo Bonaventura and Lucas Martinez-Quarta scored Fiorentina's other goals at the Stadio Artemio Franchi as the hosts moved level on seven points with champions Napoli and Frosinone, 4-2 winners over Sassuolo earlier in the day. Eusebio Di Francesco's Frosinone won a Serie A game from a losing position for the first time in their history. They came back from being two goals down in the first 25 minutes to claim an impressive home win thanks to a Walid Cheddira penalty on the stroke of half-time, Luca Mazzitelli's brace and a stoppage-time finish from Pol Lirola. Atalanta are two points back in ninth after their second defeat in their opening four matches, which means that Lecce stay in the Champions League positions despite only drawing 1-1 at Monza. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। """

The Tigers beat Pakistan to qualify for the final and lost to eventual champions India. But Pakistan’s eleven has come a long way from what it was in 2018 and is mighty strong, especially when it comes to their fast bowling. Bangladesh have made the Asia Cup final three times but are still searching for their first trophy. Can Shakib Al Hasan’s side put an end to their trophy hunt? The wait continues but before that let’s take a look at Bangladesh’s strengths, weaknesses, and chances of winning. The Tigers begin their Asia Cup mission with an encounter against Sri Lanka. Can the Tigers trump the Lankans in their opening fixture? To discuss all of this and much more, The Daily Star brings you Star Non-Striker’s End. Pakistan would be forgiven for feeling like gladiators thrown into the Colosseum when they face an India team egged on by 100,000-plus fans in Saturday's World Cup blockbuster, but skipper Babar Azam sees the match as a chance to end a jinx against their arch-rivals. Despite losing their second consecutive game in the World Cup, pacer Mustafizur Rahman still feels that Bangladesh can win their remaining six matches of the group stage and qualify for the semifinals. Kane Williamson made 78 on his long-awaited return to lead New Zealand to an eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh at the World Cup on Friday but was forced to retire hurt with a hand injury. Bangladesh were potentially handed a double blow on Friday as the Tigers saw skipper Shakib Al Hasan walk off the field with an injury in their heavy eight-wicket defeat against New Zealand at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai yesterday.

Bangladesh’s top-order woes start from the opening partnership, where the returns have been slim throughout 2023. Bangladesh have lost Mehedi Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto as well after losing both openers earlier in the innings. Does a Chepauk turner favour Bangladesh?

""It didn't seem like an ICC event to be brutally honest,"" the former Australia coach said after Pakistan's seven-wicket loss. ""It seemed like a bilateral series, it seemed like a BCCI event. ""I didn't hear 'Dil Dil Pakistan' coming through the microphones too often tonight,"" he said, referring to the unofficial anthem for the country. ""So yes, that does play a role, but I'm not going to use that as an excuse because for us it was about living the moment, it was about the next ball and it was about how we were going to combat the Indian players tonight."" Only half a dozen Pakistani journalists arrived on the eve of the match and the ICC said they were trying to sort out the visa issues. Asked if it was right for a World Cup, Arthur said: ""Look, I don't think I can comment on that just yet. I don't want to get fined.""  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 | Live Cricket Scores | CWC2023 fixtures | The Daily Star","Pakistan team director Mickey Arthur was upset by the lack of their fans at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Saturday but would not blame the team's comprehensive defeat by India on the absence of support from the stands. Skipper Rohit Sharma’s 86 and an inspired bowling display helped India hammer Pakistan by seven wickets in their high-profile World Cup clash at the 132,000-capacity Ahmedabad stadium on Saturday. India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and asked Pakistan to bat first in their highly-anticipated clash of the World Cup at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad today. The stands at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai were mostly empty for today’s Bangladesh-New Zealand World Cup match with some clusters of fans sprinkled across the massive gallery. Bangladesh were potentially handed a double blow on Friday as the Tigers saw skipper Shakib Al Hasan walk off the field with an injury in their heavy eight-wicket defeat against New Zealand at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai yesterday. Defiant Pakistan captain Babar Azam declared Friday that ""records are meant to be broken"" as his team looks to break free of India's World Cup stranglehold when the bitter rivals clash on Saturday. Despite losing their second consecutive game in the World Cup, pacer Mustafizur Rahman still feels that Bangladesh can win their remaining six matches of the group stage and qualify for the semifinals. As the much-anticipated World Cup clash between India and Pakistan unfolds in Ahmedabad today, cricket fans, regardless of their allegiances, are poised to savour every sumptuous bit of action. Soft dismissals, unforced errors have led to the demise of the Bangladesh top-order in recent times, and it was no exception against New Zealand in their third ICC World Cup fixture in Chennai yesterday. Kane Williamson made 78 on his long-awaited return to lead New Zealand to an eight-wicket victory over Bangladesh at the World Cup on Friday but was forced to retire hurt with a hand injury. In September, tickets were going for as much as 55 lakh rupees in the secondary market. Gill missed the team's opening two victories but is likely to take the field at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday. Boult, 34, reached the personal landmark when he dismissed Towhid Hridoy, caught at extra cover by Mitchell Santner for 13, in the 38th over. Bangladesh’s top-order woes start from the opening partnership, where the returns have been slim throughout 2023. Bangladesh have lost Mehedi Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto as well after losing both openers earlier in the innings. Does a Chepauk turner favour Bangladesh? That would be the question fans and the Tigers’ cricket fraternity are wondering about the most ahead of Bangladesh’s World Cup game against New Zealand today at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Chennai. The match is slated to begin at 2:30 PM (Bangladesh Time). New Zealand took on Bangladesh last month as part of their preparations for the 50-overs showpiece in India. Quite a few of the hospitals have seen a sudden influx of patients booked in for check-ups involving a night's stay to coincide with the most anticipated match of the World Cup. Australia were dismissed for just 177 with 55 balls to spare in pursuit of South Africa's 311-7 despite winning the toss. According to Shanto, there was no negativity in the dressing room after the huge 137-run defeat against England. "
"India continue WC dominance over Pakistan | The Daily Star","Skipper Rohit Sharma's 86 and an inspired bowling display helped India hammer Pakistan by seven wickets in their high-profile World Cup clash at the 132,000-capacity Ahmedabad stadium on Saturday. India bowled out Pakistan for 191 after their rivals collapsed from 155-2. They overhauled the total with 117 balls to spare to extend their unbeaten streak against their neighbours to eight in the 50-over showpiece tournament. Rohit stood out in his 63-ball knock laced with six fours and six sixes to keep India, who began the event as favourites to win the title, unbeaten in their three matches in this edition. Pakistan now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament. ""It felt good,"" said man of the match, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah who had figures of 2-19 off nine overs. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground with his delightful flicks and pulls to entertain an almost all-Indian crowd at the world's biggest cricket stadium after Pakistanis were effectively banned from attending. India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli -- both for 16 -- before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory. Rohit fell attempting another hit off Shaheen Shah Afridi to get caught at mid-wicket, but Iyer and KL Rahul took the team home with ease. Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. The total was Pakistan's third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world's number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman's gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his fifty with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Bumrah, playing in front of his home crowd, had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. ""You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,"" added Bumrah. ""There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped - it was one of those days."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"New Zealand have 'good information' on Bangladesh, says Conway | The Daily Star","New Zealand know all about the threat posed by Bangladesh after playing the Asian side in the build-up to the Cricket World Cup, opener Devon Conway said ahead of the sides' meeting in Chennai later on Friday. New Zealand took on Bangladesh last month as part of their preparations for the 50-overs showpiece in India, beating them 2-0 in a One-Day International series and chalking up sizeable margins of victory in both matches. The Black Caps have brought that form into the World Cup, thrashing defending champions England by nine wickets in the opener before beating the Netherlands by 99 runs to sit second in the table. ""We couldn't have asked for a better start with two wins and four points. The guys are excited to get out there and put up a good show against Bangladesh,"" Conway said. ""Bangladesh are a strong group, we're fortunate to have played a fair few ODI games against them recently. We've got good information on the group and how they go about things. ""They are crafty with the ball, they've got some good spinners and some good seamers up front as well."" The 32-year-old said he was pleased that team mate Rachin Ravindra, with whom he combined for an unbroken 273-run partnership in the win over England, was getting the recognition he deserved. In addition to his 123 against England, all-rounder Ravindra also scored a half-century against the Netherlands and has picked up two wickets so far. ""That partnership we shared in Ahmedabad was special. It's great to see him show the world what he's got,"" Conway said. ""Rachin's a special person, he's a 23-year-old with the mind of a 40-year-old. He doesn't get too far ahead of himself, he takes each day as it comes. It's special for him to get the acknowledgment he deserves. ""He's done really well in the first two games at the World Cup, where there's a lot of pressure."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Shakib ‘under observation’ as Tigers regroup | The Daily Star","The Bangladesh cricket team landed in Pune yesterday ahead of their next World Cup encounter against India, as they awaited the medical report of skipper Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib was hurt in Friday's World Cup fixture in Chennai and had to leave the pitch before the Bangladesh-New Zealand match ended in Chennai - owing to a left quadriceps injury. He was taken for a scan after the game. His availability for Bangladesh's fourth World Cup fixture, on October 19 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, hinged on the MRI scan report - which were due to arrive yesterday. Bangladesh physio Bayjedul Islam Khan did not reveal the results at the end of the day but informed that Shakib's fitness for the upcoming matches will be ""under observation"". ""We will clinically assess his day-to-day progress and take measures accordingly,"" he added. The game's opening innings saw the ace all-rounder suffer from cramping while batting. He tried to hit his way out of trouble, but it cost him his wicket. Later, Shakib was seen standing at the slip before leaving the field early after bowling out the full quota of 10 overs. Bangladesh suffered their second consecutive defeat in the tournament after falling to New Zealand by an eight-wicket margin. It will thus be crucial for the Tigers to regroup before their next game. The Tigers are scheduled to resume training on October 17 as the team management decided to give the cricketers a two-day rest in Pune to recover from the physical and emotional stress of the crushing defeats to England and New Zealand. ""We should have a good rest. The danger here is that the World Cup games come thick and fast,"" Bangladesh assistant coach, Nic Pothas, told the media on Friday. ""They are high-pressure [matches]. These games take a lot out of you. You get into a more-is-more situation. You think more practice helps but it doesn't. We will be giving the players a good amount of mental and physical rest to help prepare for India,"" added the South African coach. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's failure at the top-order in all three World Cup matches has drawn attention towards the repeated reshuffling of the batting order, prompting harsh criticism from all quarters. Mehedi Hasan Miraz was dropped to number five against England after making a fifty against Afghanistan - before returning to number three against New Zealand. Najmul Hossain Shanto, who had been nurtured as the number three batter over around the past year and had scored substantially in that position, batted fourth against Afghanistan in the first game. The 25-year-old batted at number three against England, but was moved to number four again against New Zealand. Towhid Hridoy, another young batter who made his mark since making his ODI debut at number five and scored over 500 runs this year in that position, has batted at number seven so far in the World Cup. According to Pothas, the batters are aware of their roles. ""This is modern cricket. The batters know that they have to be flexible and adaptable. They are all dependent on our opposition and conditions. A lot of thought goes into [the batting-order],"" said Pothas. Even vice-captain Shanto was unable to explain why the batting-order was constantly being shuffled. He stated that it was primarily the coach and captain's decision. Obviously, the team management might devise a different strategy at times, taking into account the opposition's strengths and shortcomings. However, if the reshuffling continues between matches, the players tend to have a clarity over their roles, leading to a collective failure as evidenced so far in the main event. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Injured Shakib to remain under observation | The Daily Star","Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan will remain under the observation of the Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) medical wing following his injury scare against New Zealand, said a press release from the BCB. Shakib felt some discomfort near his left quadriceps while batting during the team's ICC ODI World Cup match against the Kiwis in Chennai. The all-rounder was taken for an MRI after the match. Although the board hasn't revealed what came up in the scans, the board did send an update on Shakib's current condition. ""The player felt uncomfortable in the left quadriceps region when he was batting. He later fielded and completed his full quota of ten overs. He had an MRI scan done after the game and we will continue to observe his fitness for the coming matches,"" national team's physio Bayjedul Islam Khan was quoted as saying in the press release. ""We will clinically assess his day-to-day progress and take measures accordingly,"" the statement added.

"The Tamim-Shakib fiasco and Bangladesh’s prospects at the World Cup | The Daily Star","On Friday, after Mehedi Hasan Miraz came out for the toss for Bangladesh's warm-up match against Sri Lanka in Guwahati, naturally the viewers started to wonder where Shakib Al Hasan was. The broadcasters said that Shakib had apparently hurt his ankle the previous day while training and wouldn't be taking part in the warm-up game. The seriousness of his injury wasn't clarified initially, which allowed the rumour mill to start churning out speculations. The news of Shakib being ruled out for Bangladesh's World Cup opener against Afghanistan on October 7 spread on social media like wildfire. This news should have hit the Bangladesh fans like a thunderbolt. But the reaction to the news was mixed to say the least. Many fans reacted to the news as if divine justice had struck to correct the wrong that had occurred a few days earlier. A little while later, when it was revealed that Shakib had only suffered a minor niggle, it was now the turn of Shakib fanatics to rejoice and they did so by mocking the 'rival fans' for their premature celebration. This divide among the fans has been the byproduct of the mudslinging between two of the country's biggest sporting icons – Shakib and Tamim Iqbal. The seeds of the clash were sown long ago. Their frosty relationship was an open secret for many years and became public knowledge after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon declared it to the world in an interview. The retirement-unretirement saga of Tamim, him stepping down as captain and Shakib returning as the ODI skipper – they were all small tremors leading up to the earthquake that shook Bangladesh cricket just days before the World Cup. Tamim, the country's leading run-scorer in all formats, had been left out of the World Cup squad. The opener, however, claimed that he wasn't snubbed but had actually told a highly influential member of the board to leave him out of the squad as he didn't want to be part of the 'nasty games' being played against him in a heated conversation over the phone. Whether Tamim was left out or he took himself out, the end result remains the same: Tamim is not going to play in the World Cup for Bangladesh. With that in mind, the most important question going forward is where does it leave the Bangladesh team ahead of the World Cup? Well, the brief answer is, not in a great spot. A quick look at the 15-man squad shows that Bangladesh have gone in with a bowling-heavy squad. For the first time ever, the Tigers have selected five specialist pacers in the World Cup – Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and Tanzim Hasan Sakib. There are also four spin bowling options, a couple of left-armers in Shakib and Nasum Ahmed and the duo of right-arm off-spinners in Mehedi and Mahedi Hasan. Liton Das and the young Tanzid Hasan Tamim are the two frontline opening batters in the squad. The selectors took the gutsy call of not taking a back-up opener as they are depending on Mehedi to come good as the makeshift opener when called upon. Najmul Hossain Shanto is Bangladesh's most in-form batter heading into the World Cup. The southpaw averages a shade below 50 in ODIs in 2023 at a strike rate of 86.92 and his performances at No.3 will be pivotal for Bangladesh. The middle-order of Shakib, Towhid Hridoy and Mushfiqur Rahim is Bangladesh's strongest point in the batting order. When these three are not busy repairing the innings after an all-too-familiar top-order collapse, they have the ability to make up for Bangladesh's glaring lack of firepower at No.7. The veteran Mahmudullah has also made his comeback months after many had written the epitaph of his ODI career and could occupy the vacant No.7 spot. But from what Shakib and coach Chandika Hathurusingha have said in the build-up to the tournament, it can be assumed that Bangladesh are likely to adopt the horses for courses approach, making changes in personnel and batting positions based on opposition and condition. An honest comparison between Bangladesh and the other competing teams in the tournament also doesn't present a rosy picture for the Tigers. The fact that the tournament is being played in a round-robin format is also not helpful for a team like Bangladesh as it means that one or two big wins won't be enough to progress to the next stage. At the very least, they need more victories than defeats. There is no reason to think that Bangladesh's fortunes would have looked radically better had Tamim been picked. But the drama leading up to his exclusion and the ugly spat that followed has divided the country's cricket fans. Shakib will have the team of his desire at his disposal in the World Cup. The process of achieving that squad, however, was questionable to say the least. Now it's up to the skipper to deliver on his promise and make this Bangladesh's best ever World Cup. Given the chaos leading up to the World Cup and the terrible precedent set by Shakib and Tamim, anything short of that will be unacceptable. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Papon thinks three-format captaincy will put too much pressure on Shakib | The Daily Star","Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan Papon said that he would discuss with Shakib Al Hasan which formats the cricketer wants to captain, following the declaration that Shakib will lead Bangladesh in the Asia Cup and World Cup – both in 50-over format. Shakib, already the captain of Test and T20 sides, has been handed this responsibility following Tamim Iqbal's stepping down due to injury. Papon, talking to reporters at his residence on Friday, said it would be tough for Shakib to continue captaining in three formats. ""I think it will be tough for him to captain in three formats. I can't say about this without discussing with him,"" Papon said. ""If he says he wants to captain in one format, then it's one thing. He might say he wants to captain in two formats, maybe in white ball or red ball. Then it's another thing. He might even say he's comfortable in captaining in three formats. So we want to discuss with him first and then take a decision through the board. ""But I think he might be under much pressure if he wants to captain in three formats given the amount of matches we have coming up,"" the board president opined. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Tiger turned Cop: Mehrab cherishes new role | The Daily Star","A career switch is never easy and for a former cricketer, who has played at the highest level for their country, it is probably even more difficult. Recently pictures surfaced on social media showing former Bangladesh batter Mehrab Hossain junior being sworn into the Niagara Regional Police in Canada. He was sworn in before receiving the duty badge from the chief of Niagara Regional Police Bryan MacCulloch, at the Niagara Regional headquarters. Mehrab, who played seven Tests, 18 ODIs and two T2OIs for Bangladesh, was an aspiring commentator but decided to move to Canada in 2018 as a student. At that time, he was still a regular face in the country's domestic competitions. ""It was a sudden plan. I didn't even share it with too many people. I guess now I can share the thought process behind my plan, I knew I would probably be able to play for four-five more years and then maybe pursue my career in commentary but once I became a father, I had to think about my children's future and seeing the struggle of a regular citizen in Bangladesh was concerning for me. I was lucky and privileged to have a good life and thanks to Allah and then cricket for that,"" Mehrab told The Daily Star. After the initial struggles, Mehrab got his Permanent Residency in 2021 and after that, he was able to do a few better-paying jobs but the 36-year-old was not satisfied with those roles. Eventually one of his friends suggested him a job posting issued by the Niagara Regional Police Service and it turned out to be the beginning of a new chapter for Mehrab. ""One of my friends, Tisham Mohammed, who is a banker here, wanted me to join the police and had sent me the job posting that said Niagara Regional Police Service is hiring. I never thought that link would be the turning point in my career. Soon after, I applied and then got accepted. After a long strenuous five-month hiring process and 20 weeks of intense training, where I had to stay away from family for 13 weeks in a residential camp which felt like I was back in BKSP, I was able to call myself Constable Hossain. After playing for the country, this was probably the most satisfying moment that I felt in terms of my professional career. I received my badge from the Chief of Niagara Regional Police on Sept 7,"" he said. Although the former left-handed batter does not get the time to follow Bangladesh cricket anymore but he is still in touch with his former teammates Mahmudullah Riyad, Enamul Haque jr and Nazmul Hossain. They have a WhatsApp group to discuss about cricket. He recently met Shakib Al Hasan who was in Canada to take part in the Global T10 league. However, when asked whether Bangladesh cricket is heading towards the right direction, Mehrab felt that the lack of communication between the board and the players has often caused issues on and off the field which is something he said needed fixing. ""Well, it is very hard to have an opinion when I am so far away from the scene but from what I hear and observe on social media and the news, I was a little upset with all the drama that has been going on around Tamim and Riyad. It seems it has become a norm in Bangladesh cricket to castrate senior cricketers and not give them the respect that they deserve. We have seen that happen with Mashrafe. Mushfiqur also had to go through some drama as well, and now Tamim and Riyad. We should remember that those five or six names as well as the youngsters, are a big reason why Bangladesh is currently as a team and none of us can deny that,"" he said. According to Mehrab, the time has come for Bangladesh to lift a major trophy in international cricket considering the mixture of youth and experience in the current team. In terms of his personal goals, Mehrab who is determined to prevent crime and help the community is willing to join the Homicide unit which is a specialty unit in the service and serve the people of Canada. However, he did not forget to mention, ""I might be living in Canada but my culture is in my heart and I am always a Bengali and I will uphold and represent my country to the highest standard no matter where I am or work."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Tanzim’s Misogynistic Posts: BCB parrots player’s defence, says he is sorry | Tanzim Sakib’s Viral Misogynistic Post On Women’s Rights | The Daily Star","Four days after screenshots of Bangladesh pacer Tanzim Hasan Sakib's misogynistic social media posts went viral, Bangladesh Cricket Board faced the media yesterday, but could only offer what amounted to a mere apology on the player's behalf. As of late last night, Tanzim himself did not apologise directly for the posts that questioned the right to employment and freedom of at least half the country's population. Moreover, in the course of yesterday's press conference, BCB Cricket Operations Committee Chairman Jalal Yunus's words raised doubts about whether the sport's national governing body indeed understood the extent of the problem and damage Tanzim's posts caused. ""About the posts on women, he [Tanzim] said 'I take responsibility for this' … He said, 'My mother is a woman; I can never be a misogynist'."" Jalal was repeating what Tanzim had supposedly said during a ""discussion"" with BCB officials regarding the posts. The cricket operations chairman said Tanzim told them he did not make the posts to hurt anyone, and that if his posts did hurt anyone, ""he was sorry for that"". He also said they would monitor Tanzim's activities from now on, and that they had cautioned him. In that, there was a tacit admission that there was no monitoring of a young cricketer's activities on social media thus far – a cricketer who came under BCB's wing at a tender age. In September 2022, Tanzim said in a post on Facebook that women being gainfully employed deprived their husbands and children of their rights, and brought ruin to family and society. More recently, he said in a post that if one married a woman habituated to ""free mixing"" addas, he would be depriving his children of a modest mother. These were the two posts that went viral after Tanzim, an Under-19 World Cup winner in 2019, bowled superbly on his ODI debut to help deliver a consolation win against India in the Asia Cup on Friday. He has deleted both posts, but not before those garnered hundreds of comments expressing approval and support. A national cricketer may thus have influenced many others to follow a line of thinking that, according to the BCB, he has now apologised for. The BCB is a signatory to the International Cricket Council's anti-discrimination policy, in which the sport's global governing body says that all of its members should ""not at any time offend, insult, humiliate, intimidate, threaten, disparage, vilify or unlawfully discriminate between persons based on their race, religion, culture, colour, descent, nationality, ethnic origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status and/or maternity status"". The cricket board also has a code of conduct that contracted players must abide by. Although Tanzim is not yet on the list of those players, a BCB official, preferring anonymity, said a player comes under the code of conduct once he or she plays for the national cricket team. This code of conduct includes instructions on how to conduct media interactions and what he can or cannot say publicly, according to the BCB official. But the BCB apparently does not think his indiscretions warrant a public apology, nor any kind of official censure. Jalal said they would definitely take action if Tanzim did something like this again. ""He said he was sorry. He said he would refrain from making such posts in the future,"" Jalal said. ""As he has admitted his mistake … he said a big thing -- he is not a misogynist. He said 'My mother is a woman; how can I be a misogynist?'"" Tanzim's surge to fame and national popularity apparently increased people's scrutiny of his activities, and the BCB moved to address it only after that scrutiny caused an uproar that refused to die down. That they then chose, not once but twice, to parrot one of the most transparently disingenuous defences against the charge of misogyny, that one can't hate women because their mother is a woman (as if there are exceptions to that reality), is a disservice to women, obviously, but also to Tanzim. A mitigating factor in Tanzim's discriminatory speech can be that he is just 20 years old and therefore not yet quite hardened enough to be immune to bigoted influences. But what of the apparently wise old heads in the BCB? Have they provided him any guidance since the time he came under their guardianship as an impressionable mid-teen? The cricket operations that Jalal oversees involve both men and women cricketers. By choosing to make excuses for Tanzim, what message is he sending to the women cricketers who have arguably brought more plaudits for the nation than their male counterparts? The BCB had an opportunity to set an emphatic example yesterday against discrimination and misogyny. They could easily have pointed out the error in Tanzim's assertions – he lives and plies his trade in a country that earns a chunk of its foreign currency through a majority-female workforce in the RMG sector, a country that prides itself on women empowerment, and one that has been led by women for the past 32 years. They could have arranged for Tanzim to make a public apology on the platform where his posts brought out similarly misogynistic echoes. The governing body could also have made a statement about the fact that he is a role model, and as such the ""freedom of speech"" argument offered does not hold. As a national cricketer, who earned the blue check beside his name because of his status, Tanzim has a greater responsibility than the ordinary social media user. That BCB's policy and code of conduct implementation is failing the cricketers and the nation at large was exemplified by a more senior national cricketer, Mehedi Hasan Miraz. The all-rounder, who has been part of the national team for the last seven years, posted on Facebook in defence of Tanzim yesterday evening, before deleting it a short while later. If Mehedi, who has played 146 matches and is talked about as a future captain, does not know better than to inflame sentiments with his social media presence, what hope was there for Tanzim or others of his scant experience? There is precedent for taking action in such cases. England bowler Ollie Robinson, having taken seven wickets in his debut Test in 2021, was banned for eight matches after racist and misogynistic Tweets from a decade ago resurfaced. In taking the action, the England and Wales Cricket Board sent a strong message of zero tolerance against hate speech. The BCB missed that opportunity yesterday. Instead, they chose to talk about how mothers cannot birth misogynists. That is true to an extent. Misogynists are not born; they are shaped by the ills of society and the indifference of those in power, and unfortunately, the BCB yesterday played its part to that end. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"‘Will try to achieve what Bangladesh have never achieved’ | The Daily Star","From being brutally trolled on social media at the beginning of his career to becoming the mainstay of Bangladesh's batting line-up in recent years, Najmul Hossain Shanto has come a long way as a cricketer. The 25-year-old, who is set to play his maiden ODI World Cup, will definitely play a crucial role for the Tigers in the mega event in India. The in-form batter opened up about his game, and expectations from the showpiece event along with a few other topics during an exclusive interview with The Daily Star's Mazhar Uddin. The excerpts of the interview are given below: The Daily Star (DS): This will be your maiden ODI World Cup. What are your expectations from this event? Najmul Hossain Shanto (NHS): To be honest, I don't want to keep any expectations since what is more important for us is how well we can do as a team. If I talk about expectations, my aim will be to perform for my team in every match. However, I am not thinking about the outcome. I will try to do my best in every situation and play according to the demands of my team. DS: What is your favourite Bangladesh World Cup memory? NHS: The first thing that comes to my mind is the 2015 World Cup game against England. I think it was a memorable tournament for us as we qualified for the quarterfinals for the first time. I was playing for the Under-15 side back then and I can remember the cheer from all of us when Rubel [Hossain] bhai bowled Stuart Broad [James Anderson] to win the game. I must also mention Shakib [Al Hasan] bhai's performance in the 2019 World Cup where he was terrific throughout the tournament. DS: Now you seem to enjoy your time in the middle even in tough situations. What sort of change in mindset did you have? NHS: At one point I think the expectations piled up on me and I was unable to enjoy the game which is the reason it hampered my performance. What I do now is, whether I score runs or not, whether my team is in a good or bad position, I try to enjoy the game. DS: As you bat at a crucial position and the team also relies heavily on you, how do you see your role as a batter? NHS: I don't see myself differently or think of any extra responsibilities. Whenever I go to bat, I think of giving my best for the team according to the demands of the situation. Obviously, my position is very important and yes, we haven't had consistency at the top order recently and maybe we didn't do well in the last four or five games. But I think if we don't overthink this aspect and if we can bat according to our plan, we can do better. What I do is try to focus on my strengths and do what is within my capacity, refraining from doing anything extraordinary. DS: Any specific bowler in world cricket you think can pose threat to the batters? NHS: To be honest, I don't think of any individual bowler. I try to focus on the ball and not on who's bowling. Obviously, there are some great bowlers in world cricket who make life difficult for the batters such as Mitchell Starc, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Trent Boult and a few others who can be devastating on their given day. DS: As a team, what are the expectations from the upcoming World Cup? NHS: We can expect a lot of things and as a team, our expectation is very high. But rather revealing our expectations the important thing for us will be to focus on how good we can play match by match. I can say we will try to achieve what Bangladesh have never achieved in the World Cup, and the type of team we are, we will play to become champions. But it's also important we don't think too far. The team we have and if we remain fit, I hope it's possible for us to get a very good result. The other thing is that we will have the same expectations and goals throughout the tournament. The sentiment of the general people or the media is that we become a very bad team when we lose a game and drastically become a great team when we win a game. But as players, we do not think that way. We go to the ground to win every game. DS: What is your favourite Bangladesh World Cup memory? NHS: The first thing that comes to my mind is the 2015 World Cup game against England. I think it was a memorable tournament for us as we qualifed for the quarterfinals for the first time.

DS: You performed consistently in all formats recently. Having gone through a lot of ups and downs at the start of your career, what are the things that played a role in your transformation? NHS: Obviously, I did not have a smooth start to my international career. Everyone expected a lot from me. But to be honest, I haven't made huge changes as I tried to work on my mistakes and analysed my shortcomings in the nets, and worked specifically on those. I think it is because of those specific works that I am getting the results now. But I must say that I went through an important phase of my career when I changed my training pattern along with my mindset. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Our first aim is to reach semifinals, says Hathurusingha | Bangladesh vs Afghanistan World Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha was in no mood to be drawn into controversies ahead of the team's opening match against Afghanistan on Saturday, especially after the build-up to the mega event had been dogged with controversies more than on-field performances. The Shakib-Tamim saga took all the limelight in Bangladesh's build-up to the World Cup. The coach's comments regarding Bangladesh's chances and expectations in the World Cup also raised a few question marks after he had said that 'those who were dreaming of seeing Bangladesh win the World Cup should wake up'. In the pre-match press conference on Friday, the Sri Lankan cleared the air regarding that interview, saying: ""My job is to take the pressure off the players."" Talking about the team's expectations in the tournament, Hathurusingha reiterated, like in that interview, that semifinals would be their first realistic target. ""We all want to win the World Cup but as you rightly asked me realistically is that if we win 4-5 games, we give ourselves a chance to get into the semifinal of the knockout stage -- that's our first aim,"" Hathurusingha said. I think we have a good enough team to do that - our first aim is to getting to the semifinal stage."" When asked specifically whether people can dream about this team, Hathurusingha asserted that winning matches and targeting the semifinals was their main aim. ""People can dream, people can aim, people can have goals. Whatever the word you use, it is the same thing,"" the Sri Lankan said. ""We're trying to have a good World Cup and win matches. That's the main aim for me. As I just said to him, our aim is to get into the semifinal, that can be a dream or can be an aim - doesn't matter."" The high-point of the controversies ahead of the World Cup was Tamim Iqbal's exclusion from the squad and skipper Shakib Al Hasan calling Tamim 'childish and not a team member' in a notorious TV interview just a few days ago. When asked whether the Hathurusingha has spoken to Shakib about the issue, the coach said: ""I had a conversation about his batting, bowling, and captaincy."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Tamim Iqbal in Dharamshala! | No Tamim in Bangladesh World Cup squad | The Daily Star","The last time Bangladesh played in Dharamshala was back in 2016 during the ICC T20 World Cup. In that match against Oman, Tamim Iqbal made history by becoming the first Bangladeshi to score a century in the format. Even though Tamim is not a part of this World Cup campaign but, thanks to the fans, his presence was felt at the picturesque Dharamshala stadium during Bangladesh's match on Saturday. A number of Bangladesh supporters in the gallery were seen holding up a placard written, 'We will never forget you' with Tamim's picture, reminiscing the contributions of the former Bangladesh captain. Shoriful's World Cup transition Just three years ago, pacer Shoriful Islam was part of the Bangladesh squad that emerged victorious in the ICC Under-19 World Cup in South Africa. On Saturday, the left-arm pacer made his World Cup debut for the senior side and his two scalps had contributed to his team's six-wicket win in their tournament opener against Afghanistan. Shoriful said that he hopes the senior side will replicate the U-19 team's feat. ""If I compare it to the Under-19 World Cup, I think we have started in a similar manner and we are all supporting each other. We want to finish it in the same way and win the World Cup."" Shoriful's U-19 teammates Tanzid Hasan and Tawhid Hridoy also made his World Cup debut yesterday but the latter did not get a chance to bat. Ashraful's new role Mohammad Ashraful was seen in a different role in Dharamshala. The former Bangladesh captain is working as an expert analyst for a Bangladeshi TV channel in the World Cup. ""I think it's a very tough job to be honest, but I am enjoying this role. This is my first time here in Dharamshala and I think Bangladesh played really well today (Saturday)."" The youngest Test centurion in the history of cricket praised Mehedi Hasan Miraz's all-round performance, adding that he has emerged as the game changer for Bangladesh. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

"India Vs Pakistan World Cup 2023: Rohit says India in nice 'rhythm' ahead of Pakistan clash | The Daily Star","India skipper Rohit Sharma on Friday said the team remains confident going into a ""massive"" World Cup clash with arch-rivals Pakistan at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. The two powerhouses renew their rivalry on Saturday at the 132,000-seater Narendra Modi Stadium, named after the Indian Prime Minister. Favourites India have won their two opening matches of the 50-over showpiece event to get past five-time winners Australia and then Afghanistan. Rohit said the team has momentum after they won the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka and then beat Australia in a three-match series. ""Rhythm is very important. If you look at it in other terms, it is called momentum,"" Rohit told reporters on the eve of the hotly-anticipated match. ""We have played seven or eight matches in India and before that in Sri Lanka and here too we played two matches of the World Cup."" He added: ""The bowlers have shown very good performances. Whether it is spinners or seamers, whenever they have got a chance to put pressure on the batsmen, they have done so. All the batsmen have scored runs."" Tournament favourites India beat Australia by six wickets and then hammered Afghanistan by eight wickets riding on Rohit's record seventh World Cup century on Wednesday. India also enjoy an unbeaten record against Pakistan in seven World Cup meetings but Rohit doesn't read too much into it. ""I am not a person who looks into all those kind of stats. We've got to play good cricket on that particular day to win the game and that is what we will be focusing on,"" said Rohit. ""And how we are going to play good cricket, which is understanding the conditions, what is required from the team's perspective and things like that."" 'Pakistan 'quality;' With Pakistan fans still awaiting visas to travel to India, the huge stadium is expecting a capacity home crowd for the key contest. Rohit, who had earlier spoken about shutting out the outside noise for the big game, said the team's focus remains on playing a quality opposition. ""Like I said many times before, in the context of it, yes, it's a massive game. But for us, what is important is, we are playing an opposition tomorrow, which will be quality,"" he said. ""So, we've just got to come against a quality opposition and play good cricket, which we've done in the last two games. And hopefully we can again show some consistency in our performance."" India crushed Pakistan by 228 runs in the Asia Cup Super Four contest -- their last ODI meeting -- in Colombo last month. But Rohit said there will be no ""psychological advantage"" against a side who have also won their first two matches in the World Cup. ""As I said, we should not pay too much attention to what is already over, he said. ""We should pay attention to the fresh day, the fresh opposition. Both the teams will start evenly.

"And then there were two… | Bangladesh world cup squad 2023 | The Daily Star","When Mushfiqur Rahim hit the winning boundary to upset India in the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbeans, people had already gotten a glimpse of the talents who would lead Bangladesh cricket in the coming years. It was the maiden World Cup campaign for three future Bangladesh stalwarts -- Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur, and Tamim Iqbal. Chaos and off-the-field issues, as it so often happens in Bangladesh cricket prior to major events, have ended Tamim's World Cup before it even began. But the 2023 edition in India is set to be a major occasion for the two other stalwarts Shakib and Mushfiqur. In a testament to their quality and longevity in international cricket, both Shakib and Mushfiqur are set to achieve a unique feat when Bangladesh take the field in their 2023 World Cup opener against Afghanistan on October 7 in Dharamsala -- the duo are the only remnants from that 2007 World Cup to still be representing their country in this mega event. 16 years on, the game itself has evolved, and it is only obvious that many of its stalwarts would be part of that undertaking. For instance, Rahul Dravid, the Indian skipper who had received a reality check from Shakib and Co more than a decade ago, will still be a part of the Indian contingent this time around but only in the dugout as their head coach.  Sourav Ganguly, India's opener back then, has already opened and closed his chapter as the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. He served as the BCCI chief from 2019 to 2022. Two other cricketers who were stunned by the Tigers in that tournament were South Africa's Ashwell Prince and Charl Langeveldt. Not only have they already bid adieu to their careers as cricketers but have also proceeded in the most common post-cricket trajectory among cricketers and taken up coaching. Both had been part of the Bangladesh contingent for a while -- Prince served as the Tigers' batting coach from 2021 to 2022 while Langeveldt was the overseer of the pace bowling unit for about five months in 2019.  Pakistan skipper back then, Inzamam-ul-Haq, played his final ODI in that very tournament and is now in his second term as the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) chief selector. However, Inzamam's bloodline -- his nephew Imam-ul-Haq -- will be wielding the willow in India as Pakistan's first-choice opener. Meanwhile, over at the Netherlands team, a rare father-son connection is set to take place in the World Cup in India. When Tim de Leede donned the all-orange in 2007, his son and now a mainstay of the Dutch team, Bas de Leede was just a seven-year-old. The World Cup in India is set to be Bas' first chance to follow in his father's footsteps and make him proud. From exciting teens to the country's ambassadors, both Shakib and Mushfiqur have also gone through major transformations over the past 16 years. Having forayed into the World Cup by punching above their weight, Shakib and Mushfiqur will hope to end on a high as well. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Rohit hails India 'grit' in Pakistan rout | The Daily Star","India skipper Rohit Sharma heaped praise on his bowlers' ""grit"" for inspiring Saturday's seven-wicket World Cup rout of old rivals Pakistan. Rohit smashed a 63-ball 86 with six fours and six sixes as India chased down their 192-run target with 117 balls to spare. However, he insisted his bowlers had been key after Pakistan collapsed from 155-2 to 191 all out. ""There is no doubt about it that the bowlers set up the game for us again today. It was a great effort,"" said Rohit. ""I don't think it was a 190 pitch. At one stage we were looking at 270-280 but they came back and showed grit and that says a lot about the guys."" Man of the match Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja all took two wickets each. India now sit on top of the 10-nation table after three wins in three games. Pakistan are fourth with two wins and one defeat. ""We pride ourselves on whoever gets the ball doing the job for us. It can be someone's day. It can't be everybody's every day,"" added Rohit. ""My job as a captain is important there to read the conditions and who is the best guy to trouble the batsman."" He added: ""All in all it is looking good, and I want to keep my fingers crossed. We don't want to get too excited or get too low, we want to stay balanced."" Saturday's win was an eighth for India in eight World Cup meetings with Pakistan stretching back to their first clash at the 1992 tournament. ""I've said it quite a few times now, this was an opposition we wanted to play against because we want to play quality opposition,"" said Rohit. ""Every opposition we come up against in this tournament is quality and can beat you on any particular day."" Babar Azam, who top scored for Pakistan with 50 before his team collapsed, admitted the middle order and opening bowlers under-performed. ""We started well. We were playing normally but then we had a collapse in the middle order. We did not finish well,"" said Azam. ""Not good for us. The way we started, we were targeting 280 or 290 but the collapse cost us so our total is not good."" Azam said with such a low total to defend, he needed his fast bowlers to fire from the start. As it was, India reached 50 in 40 balls and 100 off 83. ""With the new ball, we were not up to the mark. If we had been, it might have been a different ball game,"" said Azam who hailed counterpart Rohit. ""The way Rohit played, it was an outstanding innings. After that we were just trying to take wickets to try and win the match."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Suryakumar joins Rohit, Kohli with 100 sixes in Guyana | The Daily Star","Dynamic batter Suryakumar Yadav joined an exclusive list of players with 100 sixes in men's T20I cricket as India stayed alive in their ongoing series against the West Indies with an emphatic seven-wicket victory over the Caribbean side in Guyana on Tuesday. Suryakumar smashed four sixes during a brilliant knock of 83 in the third-match of the T20I series against the West Indies and in the process became just the third men's player from India behind star duo Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to have hit a century of sixes in the shortest format of the game. No one in the world has hit more sixes than Rohit's 182, with Kohli (117) and Suryakumar (101) chasing their experienced captain and among a group of 14 men's players in international cricket to have gone past the magical three figure milestone. Suryakumar was at his magnificent best against the West Indies as he combined well with young gun Tilak Varma (49*) to ensure India successfully chased down the West Indies' modest score of 159/5 for the loss of just three wickets and with more than two overs remaining. India's victory means the five-match series is now well poised with the West Indies leading 2-1 and the remaining two games scheduled to take place in Florida on Saturday and Sunday. Spin duo Kuldeep Yadav (3/28) and Axar Patel (1/24) put the clamps on the West Indies to reduce the hosts to a meagre total after they had won the toss and elected to bat. Suryakumar wasn't fazed by the early loss of openers Shubman Gill (6) and Yashavi Jaiswal (1) as he terrorised the opposition bowlers with the clean hitting that he has become famous for in recent times. A total of 64 of Suryakumar's 83 runs came through boundaries and, by the time he was out in the 13th over, India was in a dominant position to cruise home under the watchful eyes of skipper Hardik Pandya (20*) and Varma. While Varma fell agonisingly short of a second consecutive half-century in just his third international appearance, Suryakumar was suitably impressed with the left-hander's maturity and believes the 20-year-old has a bright future in the game. ""I feel for his age, he's showing amazing maturity,"" Suryakumar said of Varma said post-match. ""He knows his game very well what he wants to do when he comes into bat and today he was very clear what he wanted to do and he's mentally very strong. ""That's the most important thing, what you need when you come into Indian dressing room and you play at this level."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Rohit hits record World Cup century as India crush Afghanistan | India beat Afghanistan by 8 wickets | The Daily Star","Captain Rohit Sharma on Wednesday surpassed compatriot Sachin Tendulkar with a record seventh World Cup century to lead India to a crushing eight-wicket win over Afghanistan. Chasing 273 for victory in New Delhi, the hosts rode on Rohit's 131 to achieve their target in 35 overs for a second straight win in the 50-over showpiece event. He brought the nearly packed house to its feet with his century off 63 balls to go past Tendulkar's record of six tons in World Cups. Rohit's century was also the fastest by an Indian in a World Cup, quicker than Kapil Dev's hundred in 72 balls against Zimbabwe in 1983. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground as he reached 1,000 World Cup runs and then went past Chris Gayle's record of 553 sixes across all formats. The dashing opener hit 16 fours and five sixes in his 84-ball knock before being bowled by leg-spinner Rashid Khan. His opening partnership of 156 with the left-handed Ishan Kishan, who made 47, extended the team's dominance after a good bowling show on a batting-friendly pitch. Superstar cricketer and Delhi-born Virat Kohli soon took over to hit an unbeaten 55 and finished the match with a boundary. Afghanistan posted 272-8 after electing to bat at the ground which witnessed a World Cup record 754 runs scored in the previous match when South Africa posted 428 and defeated Sri Lanka. Pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah stood out for the home side with his best World Cup bowling figures of 4-39. Afghanistan slipped to 63-3 before skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi (80) and Azmatullah Omarzai (62) put on 121 runs to help Afghanistan recover. Bumrah got Ibrahim Zadran caught behind for 22 and celebrated by pointing to his temple. Rahmanullah Gurbaz, on 21, and Rahmat Shah, on 16, fell in the space of four balls with Hardik Pandya and Shardul Thakur taking the wickets. Shahidi, a left-hand batsman, and Omarzai then rebuilt the innings in a century stand, prompting Rohit to rotate his bowlers. Omarzai reached his second ODI fifty and soon Shahidi smashed Pandya for four to bring up his half-century and followed it up with a six. Omarzai, who hit two fours and four sixes in his 69-ball knock, also attacked but was bowled by Pandya. Shahidi kept up the attack with regular boundaries but fell lbw to Kuldeep Yadav in his attempt to reverse sweep the left-arm wrist spinner. Bumrah struck twice including Rashid to keep Afghanistan down on a run-filled wicket. The Afghans lost their opening match to Bangladesh while tournament favourites India began with a victory over five-time winners Australia. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Suryakumar ton powers India to series win over Sri Lanka | The Daily Star","Suryakumar Yadav smashed a blazing century to help India extend their unbeaten streak of Twenty20 series wins at home to 12 with a 91-run thrashing of Sri Lanka on Saturday. The hosts rode on Suryakumar's unbeaten 112 off 51 deliveries to post 228-5 after electing to bat first in the series decider in Rajkot. India then bowled out Sri Lanka for 137 in 16.4 overs for a 2-1 triumph and keep their win record in bi-lateral series on home turf which stretches back to February 2019. Suryakumar, known as a 360-degree player for his ability to play all around the ground, stood out with his third T20 hundred -- in 45 balls -- as he stamped his class as the world's number one batsman in the format. The T20 sensation smashed seven fours and nine sixes including three off his trademark scoop shot over fine leg to entertain the raucous home crowd. India lost two wickets inside six overs after electing to bat first but Suryakumar and Shubman Gill, who hit 46 off 36 deliveries, put on 111 runs to lay the foundations for the total. Left-arm quick Dilshan Madushanka struck in the opening over to send back the left-handed Ishan Kishan, caught at slip for one by Dhananjaya de Silva. Rahul Tripathi, 31, who made his debut in the previous match, then hit back with Gill for company as he hit Maheesh Theekshana for three fours in the fifth over. Tripathi smashed fast bowler Chamika Karunaratne for two successive sixes but got caught out in an attempt to get another boundary. He made 35 off 16 deliveries. Suryakumar, who reached his fifty in 26 balls, then took charge with his all-round hitting including three sixes with his scoop shot over fine leg. Gill joined in the charge as he and Suryakumar smashed 23 runs in the 14th over from Theekshana. But after three fours and two sixes in his 36-ball knock, Gill got bowled by leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga and two more wickets fell before Suryakumar kept up the charge till the end. In reply, Kusal Mendis started briskly but fell to Axar Patel's left-arm spin for 23 in the fifth over. Wickets kept tumbling at regular intervals with skipper Hardik Pandya, fellow quick Umran Malik and leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal taking two each. Left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh took three including the final wicket. Skipper Dasun Shanaka, who helped the tourists bounce back from their opening loss in the previous match, hit 23 off 17 balls before departing.

"Heavyweights collide as India face England in second semi-final | The Daily Star","A high-octane clash is on the cards as India take on England in the second semi-final of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup in Adelaide on Thursday. India made a strong statement with their performance in the Super 12s, winning four out of their five matches and finishing at the top of Group 2. A loss to South Africa was the sole blip in an otherwise consistent group stage showing. The Indian batters have put on quite a show as well. All of Suryakumar Yadav, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul have been in strong form and will be looking to take that forward into the knock-outs. But skipper Rohit Sharma has been struggling to get big scores and his team will be hoping he can step up. On the bowling front, all the three frontline pacers – Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami and Arshdeep Singh have delivered impressive performances as well. All-rounder Hardik Pandya and off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin have also made significant contributions with the ball, claiming eight and six wickets in this campaign respectively. England bounced back well after losing to Ireland in the Super 12s. Qualifying for the semi-finals was looking quite difficult when the match against Australia was washed out, but Jos Buttler's men delivered strong performances against New Zealand and Sri Lanka to make their way into the final four. The main strength of this English side is their batting, which runs right down to number 10. The line-up is full of power-hitters right from the top, which means they can really run away with the game on decks that are good for batting and venues where the boundaries are short. The Adelaide Oval fulfils both requisites and that's why this English batting unit could be a very difficult proposition to handle for the Indian bowlers. England's bowling unit, which wasn't rated that highly ahead of the tournament, has stepped up as well. Sam Curran has been a revelation with the ball, particularly in the death. The left-armer is England's highest wicket-taker in the tournament while going at an economy rate of 6.40. Mark Wood has been relentless with his express pace as well, whereas Ben Stokes has also done a great job to pick up five wickets while going at 5.90 runs per over.   দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"ICC T20 World Cup 2022 Live Updats | The Daily Star","After an engrossing tournament spanning 28 days, England will lock horns with Pakistan in the final of the ICC T20 World Cup at the MCG in Melbourne today, starting from 2pm Bangladesh Standard Time. Securing England's second Twenty20 World Cup title would be a triumph for a team in transition but captain Jos Buttler says more success can be reaped by his seasoned squad. Captain Babar Azam told his rejuvenated Pakistan side on Saturday to ride the wave of four consecutive victories and win the Twenty20 World Cup final. Jos Buttler-inspired England and a Babar Azam-led Pakistan will be squaring off at the iconing Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday, hoping to lift their second T20 World Cup title and keeping an eye on the heavens, wishing for its doors not to open and ruin the title decider. Pakistan, England or rain – who will steal the spotlight? As we head towards the mouth-watering contest, let’s take a gander at some interesting facts and hope the finale lives up to the billing. Jos Buttler used to fantasise about captaining England to cricketing glory when he played with his siblings in their garden as a child. Now the dream is on the cusp of coming true. No matter what happens when Pakistan face England in Sunday's final at the MCG, Shadab Khan has had a Twenty20 World Cup to remember. England pace spearhead Mark Wood said he is unsure if he will recover from a hip injury in time to play in Sunday's Twenty20 World Cup final against Pakistan but could throw his name into the hat if skipper Jos Buttler desperately needs him. Captain Babar Azam told his rejuvenated Pakistan side on Saturday to ride the wave of four consecutive victories and win the Twenty20 World Cup final. Skipper Jos Buttler says the emphatic way England crushed India to reach Sunday's Twenty20 World Cup final ""doesn't count for anything"" as they bid to become champions in both white-ball formats. Pakistan have soaked up stories from the landmark 1992 Cricket World Cup final win over England in the lead up to Sunday's Twenty20 decider and hope to share their own tales of triumph in years to come, team mentor Matthew Hayden said on Friday.

"Asia Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","""Siraj's dream spell ended India's five-year title drought,"" The Times of India wrote India started the Asia Cup as underdogs, Shoaib Akhtar said, but their transformation during the campaign has now convinced him that “they could be the most dangerous side in the World Cup” ""Sometimes a bit of a kick up the rear end is not the worst thing going into a World Cup,"" Silverwood told reporters. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 6-21 to lead India’s rout of Sri Lanka by 10 wickets as they clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday. India kept their best reserved, or, Sri Lanka their worst, for Sunday’s one-sided final of the Asia Cup, a tournament played as a prelude to the World Cup in India next month. All too often ignored in favour of the big name sport stars, cricketing groundstaff who kept the rain-hit Asia Cup running were promised a $50,000 shared bonus by organisers on Sunday. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 6-21 to lead India's rout of Sri Lanka by 10 wickets as they clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj claimed six wickets including four in one over, as India skittled out Sri Lanka for a paltry 50 in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. India pacer Mohammad Siraj picked up his maiden ODI five-wicket haul to reduce Sri Lanka to 12 runs for the loss of six wickets in the Asia Cup final at the R.Premadasa Stadium on Sunday. Defending champions Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bat first against India in the final of the Asia Cup in Colombo today. Rohit Sharma's India face underdogs Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final, a crucial momentum-builder heading into next month's ODI World Cup. While Shakib warned after India's triumph that they will be ""a dangerous side in the World Cup"", Chandika labelled it as ""huge"" boost for the Tigers heading into the showpiece event. India will have an eye on extending their record haul while Sri Lanka would want to get level with the Indians when they square off in the final of the Asia Cup in Colombo today. Bangladesh all-rounder Mehedi Hasan Miraz feels that the victory against India in the last Super 4 fixture of the Asia Cup will boost their confidence, going into next month’s World Cup. Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana has been ruled out of the Asia Cup final against India due to an injury, captain Dasun Shanaka confirmed Saturday. Bangladesh’s Mustafizur Rahman might not be as mysterious as he was at the beginning of his career but the left-arm paceman managed to achieve a feat he can be happy about against India in Colombo yesterday. Ever since Bangladesh won the 2020 Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, it was expected that a pool of players from that World Cup-winning batch would one day come through for the national side. The consensus was that it would happen sooner rather than later, given the youthful exuberance portrayed by that group of players in that tournament. ""I think we have got a very good team (for the World Cup),"" man of the match Shakib, who scored 80 in Bangladesh’s 265-8, said after the win. "
"India celebrates World Cup 'booster shot' after SL 'battered' | The Daily Star","India celebrated the 10-wicket thrashing of Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final as ""a booster shot"" Monday for the one-day World Cup starting on home soil in a fortnight. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj got four wickets in one over to help skittle Sri Lanka out for 50 on Sunday, a total the Indian openers Ishan Kishan and Shubman Gill surpassed in 6.1 overs. It was India's eighth Asia Cup crown but first major tournament title since winning the same competition in 2018. ""Siraj's dream spell ended India's five-year title drought,"" The Times of India wrote. The India Express called it a ""Booster shot before World Cup"" and praised what it called the team's ""clinical and ruthless"" performance. ""Triumph lifts India's morale... just in time for the mega-event,"" it added, referring to the World Cup, which starts on October 5. In the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, where the final took place, the mood was gloomy. ""Abject surrender of Asia Cup by Sri Lanka,"" said a headline in the daily FT newspaper. The home team were bowled out in just 15.2 overs with Siraj ripping through the Sri Lankan batting with his 6-21. Sri Lanka were playing their 11th Asia Cup final but the 116-minute humiliation left fans disappointed and angry. One fan complained in a video post on social media that Sri Lanka were all out even before he could get to his seat at the 35,000-capacity Premadasa stadium. Another on social media said the Sri Lankan innings lasted less than the time taken to drink a bottle of arak, the island nation's firewater spirit made from fermented coconut or sugarcane. Colombo's Daily Mirror said the final was a ""mismatch between two opponents in completely different weight classes. ""As heavyweights India completely battered, bruised, bloodied and bashed-in Sri Lanka's flyweight batting line-up for an emphatic 10-wicket win."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Kohli stardom supreme as stage set for World Cup opener | Cricket World Cup in India | The Daily Star","If you can judge a tournament by the number of replica tops sold, the Cricket World Cup in India opening this week already has a winner -- home superstar batsman Virat Kohli. On the crowded streets outside the world's biggest cricket arena -- the 130,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium, which will host the opening match between defending champions England and New Zealand on Thursday -- hawkers report a brisk trade. Some customers are snapping up the blue top with the name of England captain Jos Buttler, and others the black shirt of Kiwi skipper Kane Williamson. But Kohli's Number 18 is the outright winner, sellers said. ""There is a huge demand for T-shirts and caps with Kohli's name,"" said Saurabh, who goes by one name, selling jerseys outside the stadium in Ahmedabad in Gujarat state. ""He is the star along with (India captain) Rohit Sharma -- and we make lot of money because of them."" Known as ""King Kohli"" for his prolific run-scoring, the star batsman has amassed 13,083 ODI runs including 47 centuries in 281 matches. Kohli, 34, remains hugely popular on social media with millions of followers. He is a crowd favourite, and fans have previously crashed through security to touch his feet or take a selfie.  'Crazy about cricket' Broadcasters are busy setting up their studios -- with millions in India alone expected to watch live -- while groundstaff labour in blazing 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) heat to get the pitch ready for play. ""People all over Ahmedabad are eagerly awaiting this World Cup,"" said Ayushi Chain, a local organiser at the stadium, adding that Kohli's presence will attract big crowds including a large ""female audience"". The epic tournament features 10 nations playing 48 matches over 46 days at 10 different venues. The Ahmedabad arena -- nearly a third bigger than the Melbourne Cricket Ground -- will be host to five matches, including the final on November 19. Organisers and officials say the tournament's blockbuster clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan on October 14 at the venue remains the most eagerly awaited match, but that demand is strong for other games too. ""The biggest rush is for the India-Pakistan match, and a lot of people will be coming from overseas,"" chief executive of the Gujarat Cricket Association Dhiraj Jogani told AFP. For the opener, England verus New Zealand, Jogani expects ""around 70,000 fans"", meaning the stadium will be just over half full, although tickets are still on sale. ""There is huge demand for tickets in every match,"" he added. ""Maybe the match involving Afghanistan (against South Africa) would be a bit weak, but for the rest there would be a sizeable number."" Chain said demand for the International Cricket Council's official mascots -- cricketing superheroes ""Blaze"" and ""Tonk"" -- had been high. ""There was a craze when they made their appearance at a city mall,"" she said. ""There is excitement among the people, we Gujaratis are crazy about cricket."" 'Streets will be packed' Many shops around the stadium are readying for the huge crowds. T-shirt seller Saurabh, currently offering the Kohli jerseys for 300 rupees ($3.60), said prices will surge. ""The price will double as the India-Pakistan match approaches"", he said. ""These streets will be packed."" Tea-seller Vijay, who uses only one name, has just finished refurbishing his stall opposite the stadium's main gate, where he swiftly pours cup after cup of super-sweet and milky tea. Vijay said around ""30,000 policemen"" had his tea when the stadium was opened by then US president Donald Trump during a rally with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2020. ""I expect a lot of police personnel to be deployed here, especially for the India-Pakistan match,"" said Vijay. ""They all will have tea at my shop."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"'Records meant to be broken': Azam shrugs off India stranglehold | India vs Pakistan World Cup 2023 match preview | The Daily Star","Defiant Pakistan captain Babar Azam declared Friday that ""records are meant to be broken"" as his team looks to break free of India's World Cup stranglehold when the bitter rivals clash on Saturday. India boast a 7-0 record over their neighbours in World Cups despite Pakistan having a healthy 73-56 overall advantage since their first one-day international clash back in 1978. ""I don't focus on the past,"" said Azam on Friday. ""Let's focus on the thing to come as we know records are meant to be broken."" ""We will try to play well and it all depends on how you play on the day, just like we did in the first two matches,"" added the skipper whose side have two wins from two at the World Cup after seeing off the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. Azam said he has told his players that Saturday's clash inside the 132,000-capacity Ahmedabad stadium is a ""golden opportunity"" to write their names into World Cup folklore. ""The India-Pakistan match is a big game, high intensity. Every such game is challenging,"" added Azam, a survivor of the 2019 World Cup clash in Manchester which India won by 89 runs. ""I have told (the players) it's the best opportunity to perform. It is a big stadium that can accommodate many fans, it's a golden opportunity for us to perform in front of these fans."" Under Azam, Pakistan broke a Twenty20 World Cup sequence of five defeats (from 2007 to 2016) against India with a 10-wicket rout at Dubai in 2021. ""Didn't we break the Twenty20 record? I am not worried about the past."" Azam also shrugged off the prospect of having virtually all of the 132,000 spectators screaming support for India with no Pakistan fans having been successful in securing visas to cross the border. ""It's not pressure,"" said Azam. ""We have played at big stadiums like at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground). ""But, yes, all the support, I think, in Ahmedabad will be for India. It would have been better had Pakistan fans been allowed. ""But I expect fans will also support us as well."" Pakistan fans from around the world have faced visa glitches due to strained relations between the two countries, who have not played a bilateral cricket series since 2007. Pakistan did tour India for limited-over matches in 2012 but that did not revive full tours which stalled in the wake of the Mumbai attacks in 2008. Azam admitted conditions in Ahmedabad are different from those at Hyderabad where Pakistan played two warm-up matches and their first two World Cup games. ""Yes, the conditions here are different,"" said Azam whose team beat the Netherlands by 81 runs and Sri Lanka by six wickets. ""You are better off at a venue where you have spent a few days but we will adapt."" Azam admitted Pakistan will look for wickets from pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi who has yet to fully fire at the tournament. Shaheen has just two wickets from two matches at a cost of 113 runs. ""He is our main bowler. Shaheen himself has a belief that he is a big match bowler,"" said the captain. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"India thrash Pakistan to make it 8-0 in World Cups | The Daily Star","Skipper Rohit Sharma's 86 and an inspired bowling display helped India hammer Pakistan by seven wickets in their high-profile World Cup clash at the 132,000-capacity Ahmedabad stadium on Saturday. India bowled out Pakistan for 191 after their rivals collapsed from 155-2. They overhauled the total with 117 balls to spare to extend their unbeaten streak against their neighbours to eight in the 50-over showpiece tournament. Rohit stood out in his 63-ball knock laced with six fours and six sixes to keep India, who began the event as favourites to win the title, unbeaten in their three matches in this edition. Pakistan now have two wins and one defeat in the 10-nation tournament. ""It felt good,"" said man of the match, Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah who had figures of 2-19 off nine overs. Rohit hit the ball to all parts of the ground with his delightful flicks and pulls to entertain an almost all-Indian crowd at the world's biggest cricket stadium after Pakistanis were effectively banned from attending. India lost Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli -- both for 16 -- before Rohit and Shreyas Iyer, who hit the winning four to reach 53, put on 77 runs for the third wicket and placed India comfortably on course for victory. Rohit fell attempting another hit off Shaheen Shah Afridi to get caught at mid-wicket, but Iyer and KL Rahul took the team home with ease. Bowlers set up victory after India elected to field and Mohammed Siraj, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets each. Pakistan were bowled out in 42.5 overs, losing eight wickets for 36 runs in 80 balls. - 'One of those days' - The total was Pakistan's third lowest against India in the World Cup after their 173 in Sydney (1992) and 180 at Manchester (1999). Pakistan started strongly but lost their openers before skipper Babar Azam (50) and Mohammad Rizwan (49) attempted to rebuild and hit back in their stand of 82. Azam reached his fifty off 57 balls with a boundary but fell in the next over, bowled by Siraj as the crowd roared to see the back of the world's number one ODI batsman. Kuldeep Yadav soon struck twice in an over to send back the left-handed Saud Shakeel and Iftikhar Ahmed, bowled around the legs for four after the ball deflected off the batsman's gloves. Bumrah denied Rizwan his fifty with a slower-off cutter that rattled the stumps as Pakistan slipped to 168-6. Bumrah, playing in front of his home crowd, had a spring in his step and struck again in the next over to get Shadab Khan out for two before Pandya and Jadeja combined to wrap up the tail. ""You try to analyse the wicket as soon as possible so when we started bowling, we came to know that the wicket was on the slower side and a hard length would make run-scoring more difficult,"" added Bumrah. ""There was no consistent turn but it was turning a little bit and I count my slower ball as a spinner so I thought it might be an option. I was trying to do that and it gripped - it was one of those days."" The hotly-anticipated match raised enormous interest with city hotels booked and desperate fans even booking full-body check ups in local hospitals to be sure of a place to sleep. A prominent hotel in the city usually charges 6,000 rupees ($72) for a deluxe room but on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the price for a day had been hiked to 70,000 rupees ($841).

Earlier Siraj struck first to get Abdullah Shafique, who made 113 in Pakistan's record chase of 345 against Sri Lanka, lbw for 20. Pandya sent back left-handed opener Imam-ul-Haq for 36 before Azam and Rizwan mounted a repair job and got regular boundaries after they were well set.

"Kane Williamson's WC hopes in doubt with fractured thumb | The Daily Star","New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been ruled out of the team's immediate World Cup matches with a fractured thumb, but head coach Gary Stead is optimistic the batter will be back in action at some stage of the tournament. After spending nearly seven months on the sidelines with a knee injury, Williamson made 78 not out in his return to action in the team's comprehensive victory against Bangladesh on Friday. The 33-year-old, however, was struck by a throw while running between the wickets during the match, which now makes him uncertain for the tournament. Tom Blundell will travel to India as cover, but Williamson will remain with the team with the hope of being available for the back end of group play next month, New Zealand Cricket said in a statement on Saturday. ""Firstly, we're all feeling for Kane to have this occur after all his hard work to return from his knee injury,"" Stead said. ""While it's disappointing news, the initial diagnosis has given us some optimism he can still feature later in the pool play following a period of rest and rehabilitation. ""Kane is clearly a massive part of our side and a world class player and captain - so we'll look to give him every opportunity we can to return in the tournament."" Blundell was picked ahead of Henry Nicholls, who suffered a mild side-strain during a Plunket Shield warm-up match the week. ""Tom's been with the one-day side on tours to Pakistan and Bangladesh and performed well,"" Stead said. ""He covers multiple positions in the batting order and his wicket-keeping skills are also an added bonus as a back-up."" The 2019 runners-up have kicked off their campaign for a maiden World Cup title with a hat-trick of victories.

Williamson (Gujarat Titans), Tim Southee (Kolkata Knight Riders), Devon Conway and Mitchell Santner (both Chennai Super Kings) will be released early after the current test series against Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Finn Allen (Royal Challengers Bangalore), Lockie Ferguson (Kolkata Knight Riders) and Glenn Phillips (Sunrisers Hyderabad) will leave the squad after the first ODI. The three-match series begins on March 25 and ends on March 31, the same day the 2023 IPL season kicks off. Tom Blundell and Will Young are back in the squad while uncapped players Chad Bowes and Ben Lister have also been called up. Lister, Mark Chapman and Henry Nicholls will join the squad ahead of the second ODI. ""Chad has been impressive for a number of seasons at the top of the order for Canterbury as well as being an excellent fielder,"" coach Gary Stead said in a statement. ""We are set to play 16 white ball matches between now and the start of May so there will be a number of chances for players to test themselves in familiar and unfamiliar conditions.

"Seifert blasts New Zealand to T20 series win over Sri Lanka | The Daily Star","Tim Seifert was the match-winner for the second straight game as New Zealand clinched the T20 series against Sri Lanka with a tense four-wicket victory in Queenstown on Saturday. Seifert blasted a career-high 88 off 48 balls to fire the Black Caps to 183-6 off 19.5 overs after the tourists had posted 182-6 in the third and final game at John Davies Oval. The opener-wicketkeeper struck 10 fours and three sixes in an innings that bore many of the hallmarks of his unbeaten 79 when New Zealand levelled the series at Dunedin on Wednesday. Captain Tom Latham provided the only meaningful support with 31 off 23 and New Zealand's middle order nearly conspired to lose the game after Seifert departed with four overs remaining. Needing to score at little more than a run-a-ball at that stage, the Black Caps stuttered. Needing 10 runs to win off the final over bowled by Lahiru Kumara (3-38), Mark Chapman struck a six off the first ball before he was the first of three New Zealand wickets to fall. With two still needed off the last two deliveries, Rachin Ravindra held his nerve to find a gap in the outfield and ran two to secure the 2-1 series win. It completes a disappointing tour for Sri Lanka, who lost the Test and ODI series by the same 2-0 scoreline but were more competitive in the shortest format. They gave themselves a shot at victory after Kusal Mendis struck a rapid 73 off 48 balls, taking full advantage after being dropped by Daryl Mitchell at slip when on 10. The opener-wicketkeeper went on to hit six fours and five sixes in his 12th half-century, falling just short of his career-high score of 79. Having been asked to bat, Mendis was the dominant figure in an opening stand of 76 with Pathum Nissanka (25 off 25), before putting on a further 46 with Kusal Perera (33 off 21). Wickets fell rapidly over the closing overs, preventing the tourists from going close to 200. Ben Lister took 2-37 while fellow-seamer Adam Milne and leg-spinner Ish Sodhi were the most economical of New Zealand's bowlers, recording identical figures of 1-30 off four overs. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Sri Lanka look to burst New Zealand's bubble in Wellington | The Daily Star","Sri Lanka are convinced they can take 20 New Zealand wickets in the second test starting in Wellington on Friday and tie the series despite losing the motivation of the World Test Championship (WTC). Sri Lanka's hopes of reaching the WTC final were ended in the series-opener in Christchurch, where they lost by two wickets in a cliffhanger decided on the last ball. As galling as that defeat was, Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne said his team were encouraged by how much pressure they put the hosts under at Hagley Oval. ""We challenged the Kiwis' top batters,"" the opening batsman told reporters on Thursday. ""Even the (New Zealand) players also talked to me and said they didn't even expect that kind of bowling pressure from the Sri Lankans. ""I have been touring New Zealand a few times but this is the first time I saw the Kiwis are struggling against the fast bowlers."" Sri Lanka's chance of a rare series win in New Zealand has gone but victory at the Basin Reserve would help them end a losing streak in the country going back to 2006 when they split a series. Motivation may be more of a challenge for the hosts in their final match of a roller-coaster home summer after the emotional highs of winning successive cliffhangers against England in Wellington and the Sri Lankans in Christchurch. Firebrand paceman Neil Wagner has been ruled out with a hamstring strain and his passion will be missed, particularly if another match goes down to the wire. Neither team have decided on their 11 but New Zealand are expected to include Doug Bracewell for his first test in years to join captain Tim Southee and Matt Henry in the pace attack. ""I think it's a deserved call-up after what he's done in domestic cricket over the last number of years,"" Southee told reporters of Bracewell, who would join his all-rounder cousin Michael in the team. ""It's exciting to have him and his skill-set around the group."" New Zealand have happy memories of their last test at the Basin Reserve where they beat England by one run, becoming only the fourth team in history to claim victory after being made to follow on. The players piled into a limousine and drove a few laps of the ground in celebration before a big night out. Southee suggested there would be no need for another limousine booking to motivate his team. ""It's our last test at home for the summer, our last test for a number of months, so I'm sure the guys will be wanting to finish what's been an exciting summer of test cricket,"" he said. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Mohammad Rafique on top in Chennai! | Bangladesh vs New Zealand | The Daily Star","The images of Shakib Al Hasan and Kane Williamson on a digital advertising board were greeting all arrivals at the airport in Chennai. The message was clear: the Bangladesh-New Zealand World Cup match will take place at the city's MA Chidambaram Stadium the next day. The distance between Dharamshala and Chennai is over 2500 kilometres, and that difference is reflected in the variances of the two region's culture, food habit and language. From the mountains in Northern India, the team is now Southern India, at the edge of the Bay of Bengal. Yes, our very own Bay of Bengal. The city of Chennai, which at one time was known as Madras, is right beside the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh's ties with this city have gotten stronger over the past few decades as many Bengalis frequent this part of India for medical purposes. There were signs of that bond everywhere. There were restaurants offering Bengali food, even some signboards were written in Bangla. Even Bengali language channels were being telecast on the television. All were clear signs that Bengalis have a sizable presence in Chennai. Like the familiar waves of the Bay of Bengal at the edge of the city of Chennai, the 22 yards inside the Chidambaram Stadium could give the Bangladesh team a sense of familiarity. The pitches here assist the spinners. According to many, Chennai is the Mirpur of India. Although the conditions are in Bangladesh's favour, no one of the current Bangladesh team has ever played at the venue. Bangladesh have played only one match at the ground in 1998 against Kenya in the Coca-Cola Cup, which they lost by 28 runs. Surprisingly, however, one Bangladeshi occupies the top-spot in the highest wicket-takers' list in ODIs at the ground. His name – Mohammad Rafique. But how could Rafique be the highest wicket-taker if Bangladesh have played just one ODI at the venue? It's because although Bangladesh have played just one ODI here, Rafique has played three. One for the Tigers and the other two for the Asian XI against the African XI. In 2007, the Afro-Asia Cup series was played in India. Two Bangladeshi cricketers - Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and Rafique - played in that series for the Asian XI under the captaincy of Mahela Jayawardene. In the second match, Rafique took two wickets for 62 runs and then in the third ODI, the left-arm spinner finished with 4-65. In the 1998 game against Kenya, Rafique took two wickets for 45 runs. Rafique, in total, has eight wickets at the venue, which puts him at the top of the ODI wicket-takers' list. India's Ajit Agarkar, Harbhajan Singh and Kuldeep Yadav and South Africa's Morne Morkel are jointly occupying the second spot with seven wickets each. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

When it comes to the World Cups, the excitement surrounding the match inevitably reaches fever pitch; to such an extent that the final match of the tournament ends up taking a back seat in terms of the anticipation factor. A crown jewel of World Cup matches, no doubt; the two teams had lived up to the billing, time and again, producing timeless moments of dramatic affairs and brilliance under pressure that got rightfully integrated in the cricketing folklore. Results in the apex event, however, have not translated to the level of competitiveness associated with an India-Pakistan clash as India's 7-0 lead hardly does justice. Sustained political tension has denied fans from seeing the two neighbouring countries play a bilateral series since 2011-12. Pakistan last toured India in 2016 for the T20 World Cup and, therefore, there could be no better stage to make up for the vacuum than the world's biggest cricket venue: the 132,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium. The organisers of the recently concluded Asia Cup had tweaked the tournament rules to have a reserve day for the India-Pakistan Super Four fixture. While that decision garnered criticism, the reasoning behind it is understandable. And regardless of how amusing it may seem, it is no surprise that traveling fans have resorted to checking in at hospitals near the Ahmedabad stadium to find reasonable lodging since hotel prices have shot up by 20 times ahead of the blockbuster match. In World Cups or otherwise, India-Pakistan matches have rarely failed to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. The stage is thus set for stars to achieve legendary status, for unlikely heroes to emerge as household names, or suffer the worst case of being the villain; for any ball bowled, any run scored possesses the potential to forever be etched in one's memory. Their timeless rivalry has, indeed, aged like fine wine. No matter who comes out victorious on the day, the sport itself will be the winner as yet another compelling contest awaits. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Trent Boult 200th ODI wicket in World Cup 2023: 'Nice to tick it off,' says Boult after 200th ODI wicket | The Daily Star","Veteran New Zealand fast bowler Trent Boult took his 200th one-day international wicket in Friday's World Cup clash against Bangladesh and admitted: ""It's nice to tick it off."" Boult, 34, reached the personal landmark when he dismissed Towhid Hridoy, caught at extra cover by Mitchell Santner for 13, in the 38th over. Playing in his 107th ODI, Boult is the sixth New Zealand bowler to break the 200-wicket mark in the format. Earlier Friday, he had dismissed Liton Das, celebrating his 29th birthday, off the first ball of the match. ""It was pretty hard not to think about the 200th wicket when it was coming up on the screen every day before the match,"" said Boult who finished the innings with 2-45 as Bangladesh made 245-9. ""It's nice to tick it off and on a bigger note nice to keep Bangladesh to a good total and hopefully we can chase it down. ""It's not why you play the game but nice to tick them off along the way. The one-day format is one I've enjoyed down the years. I feel lucky to be here in a third World Cup and contributing like I do."" Boult's 200 wickets in ODIs takes him level with Chris Cairns on New Zealand's all-time list which is topped by spin bowler Daniel Vettori who claimed 297 before he retired in 2015. In an international career which stretches back to 2011, Boult also has 317 Test wickets and 74 in T20s. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"'We can still win six matches and qualify for semifinals' | NZ vs BAN | The Daily Star","Despite losing their second consecutive game in the World Cup, pacer Mustafizur Rahman still feels that Bangladesh can win their remaining six matches of the group stage and qualify for the semifinals. Bangladesh started off with a six-wicket win over Afghanistan before suffering a 137-run defeat to England and an eight-wicket defeat to New Zealand. ""If you think professionally, there is no room for regret. Since we still have another six games, we can win all of those. I think it's not impossible,"" Mustafizur told the media after the match. The left-arm seamer also felt that the Tigers were 20 to 30 runs short as the top-order batting failed, eventually seeing the side post 245 for nine. ""I think we started well but if we had another 20-30 runs on the board, they might have charged more which would have created some chances. If we could post around 280, it would have been good for us,"" he said. Mustafizur was asked about the indifferent performance of his pace-bowling partner Taskin Ahmed. ""He didn't bowl badly today (Friday). However, at times you get wickets while there will be times when you won't get wickets even if you pray to God,"" the left-arm pacer opined. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Turner or not, Boult not taking Tigers’ lightly | Bangladesh vs New Zealand | The Daily Star","Does a Chepauk turner favour Bangladesh? That would be the question fans and the Tigers' cricket fraternity are wondering about the most ahead of Bangladesh's World Cup game against New Zealand today at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Chennai. The match is slated to begin at 2:30 PM (Bangladesh Time). On one hand, whether spin or pace holds sway at the venue is still not discernible. India spin trio dominated against Australia in the hosts' World Cup opener and despite managing a below-par score, Australia's pacers created lots of problem for India's top-order in the evening. On the other hand, Tigers' pacers have not been able to sink their teeth into the conditions that were present in Dharmasala and would be hoping to turn things around at Chennai. In the last three years, pacers dominated proceedings at the IPL in the venue. 135 wickets have fallen to pace in the last three seasons, compared to 96 for spinners. Trent Boult believes that Bangladesh have a good balance in spin and pace departments. ""Bangladesh are a quality side, very good spin setup but also very good pace-bowling stocks as well. They have been growing over the years and Fizz, Shoriful and Taskin are quality players that know the conditions well and we aren't going to take them lightly and it's a very big game for both teams,"" New Zealand pace spearhead Trent Boult told ICC ahead of the clash. India's former leg-spinner Anil Kumble meanwhile felt that the Tigers need to fire together as an unit to get past a strong opponent such as New Zealand. The Kiwis have won both their World Cup fixtures so far and their spinners too have been able to dent Bangladesh's batting recently, with Ish Sodhi picking up six wickets at an ODI in Mirpur during New Zealand's recently-concluded tour. ""They are a good side, just that they are underperforming in international cricket for a while when it comes to such tournaments. Shakib Al Hasan is the best all-rounder for a long time for Bangladesh and in world cricket. He bowled brilliantly against England on a flat surface,"" Kumble felt about Bangladesh's chances at Chepauk while talking in Cricinfo's show. ""You expect batters to play together. Liton got some runs after he didn't get runs in the previous game. They need the entire squad to sort of do well. They have a good squad and got experience. They have a couple of good young players as well. Hridoy is a very good batter. They have a good mix, it's just a matter of all of them coming together,"" he added. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Indo-Pak hysteria grips Ahmedabad | India vs Pakistan World Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","Cricket fever has gripped Ahmedabad ahead of Saturday's World Cup group stage clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan and a visit to the hospitals near the venue of the match in the western Indian city clearly shows the degree of excitement. Quite a few of the hospitals have seen a sudden influx of patients booked in for check-ups involving a night's stay to coincide with the most anticipated match of the World Cup. Several doctors told local media the rush for check-up 'packages' was an ingenious way to find affordable accommodation as hotel costs have soared up to 20 fold ahead of the match. ""We have come across some cases of people coming to watch the India-Pakistan match also taking an appointment for health check-ups and staying in hospitals,"" Tushar Patel, President of the Ahmedabad Medical Association, told Reuters. The Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association has discouraged its members from accommodating such fans. ""We have asked our members not to entertain such requests. Hospitals are not meant for non-patients,"" its president Bharat Gadhavi told Reuters. THREE WARS The Asian neighbours have fought three wars since becoming separate countries in 1947 and the relationship further soured after gunmen killed 166 people in Mumbai in 2008, which India blamed on a Pakistani militant group. While bilateral cricket became a casualty of geopolitical realities, it also whetted the appetite for a clash between neighbours who play each other only in multi-team events. India and Pakistan head into the showdown having both won their opening two matches at the tournament. The first batch of tickets for Saturday's game were sold out within an hour of going on sale in August, prompting the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to release another 14,000 earlier this month. Ahmedabad resident Hemish Patel and his friends, after several days of failed attempts, grabbed four tickets, each costing 6,000 Indian rupees ($72.15). ""We logged into the site with multiple devices,"" he said. ""We constantly kept on refreshing the site and were able to book within 10 minutes after the sale of tickets began."" Patel was one of the lucky few. Tickets are fetching up to 25 times face value on resale and city police arrested four youths on Tuesday for selling fakes. Airfare has surged up to four times and Indian railways will run a pair of super fast trains linking Mumbai and Ahmedabad. PERFECT VENUE The 134,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium, which hosted former US President Donald Trump in 2020 and Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese earlier this year, looks a perfect arena for cricket's fiercest rivalry. The city has been declared a 'no-drone zone' on Saturday, and 11,000 security personnel will be deployed for the high-profile match, Ahmedabad police commissioner GS Malik said. On their first tour of India since the 2016 T20 World Cup, Pakistan were accorded a warm welcome in Hyderabad, where they played their first two matches. India have a perfect 7-0 record against Pakistan at ODI World Cups and while the rivalry assumes the Orwellian concept of serious sport -- ""war minus the shooting"" -- players from both sides share good relations. During the Sri Lanka leg of the Asia Cup last month, Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Afridi gave Jasprit Bumrah a gift for the Indian's newborn baby and the video went viral. It will be a special occasion for Indian Liyakat Khan, whose daughter Samiya is married to Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali. ""My wife went to Pakistan in 2021 when my daughter was expecting her first child. We will meet again ... I can't wait to hold my grandchild,"" Khan told the Indian Express newspaper. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"From Houston to Ahmedabad for Pakistan fans | The Daily Star","With their green shirts drowning in a sea of blue, Mohammad Uzair and Asif Syed Ali were a rare sight in Ahmedabad -- two Pakistan fans in an Indian dominated crowd of around 120,000 witnessing the biggest show in cricket. The friends had travelled from their homes in Houston for Saturday's World Cup clash, vowing to match their counterparts ""chant for chant"". The two joined Mohammad Basheer, also from the United States, as part of the small number of Pakistan fans at the Narendra Modi Stadium, the biggest cricket stadium in the world. Visa delays have denied virtually all Pakistan fans -- especially from across the border -- the chance to travel to India despite having World Cup match tickets. ""All's well that ends well,"" said US passport holder Uzair. ""Finally, we are here but how? Don't ask. It was a lengthy and arduous visa process but we managed it and are excited to be here,"" Uzair told AFP. ""We roamed around Delhi and Uttar Pradesh before coming to Ahmedabad for the big match."" Uzair and Ali are IT workers and play cricket for the same club in Houston. ""It's strange that there will be very few Pakistan fans in the stadium but we will do our best to match them slogan for slogan,"" said Uzair, holding a banner showing both Indian and Pakistan flags. ""But we hope there are more than two Pakistan fans. It will be a match-up, just like we did at the MCG last year,"" said Uzair of the Twenty20 World Cup match between the teams in Melbourne last year. Not afraid of India's 7-0 ODI World Cup record against Pakistan, Ali hoped the jinx would be broken. ""Seven is just a number and I see a brake on India's sequence today,"" said Ali. He added in a spirit of companionship: ""But we are wearing Indian blue shirts underneath. In case they win, we will project that blue shirt."" Both men are fans of India batting star Virat Kohli. ""Kohli is a world class player and those who compare others with Kohli have no knowledge of cricket,"" said Ali, who hopes Pakistan pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi excels in Saturday's match. ""Shaheen is a world class bowler and I hope he gets wickets against India, but not Kohli!"" Also in the crowd was Mohammad Shahzad who has an Indian wife, Shabana. The couple live in Norway. ""I got a visa without delay and came last night,"" Shahzad told AFP. ""But it's disappointing that there are Pakistan fans missing. It's a sea of blue but I don't mind if Pakistan win."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Messi’s Argentina faces Bolivia in friendly | The Daily Star","The Albiceleste play their first fixture since losing to Chile in the Copa America final when they go up against their South American rivals in Houston Javier Mascherano has praised the way Lionel Messi handles the pressure of a nation's expectations as Argentina prepare to take on Bolivia in Houston. Friday's international friendly will be Argentina's first outing since they lost on penalties to Chile in the Copa America final in July. That defeat, following on from the disappointment of losing to Germany in the World Cup final 12 months earlier, led to Barcelona superstar Messi coming under fire for his inability to lead his national team to a major trophy. However, Messi has a strong ally in Mascherano, who feels his club-mate copes admirably with life in a goldfish bowl, particularly as he waits to become a father for the second time. ""Messi does not hide and never shies away from criticism,"" the midfielder told TyCSports. ""I would hate to be Messi. He is something very special. He keeps coming to the national team even when he is about to be a father. ""We are football players who want to offer the most we can. We are honest and try to do it the best way."" Mascherano and Messi are both part of Argentina's 24-man squad for the first of two friendlies on American soil in the space of four days. After going up against Bolivia, Gerardo Martino's side head to Dallas to take on Mexico. Martino is without the services of Angel di Maria, who has been allowed to remain with Paris Saint-Germain to work on his fitness, as well as injured trio Pablo Zabaleta, Javier Pastore and Lucas Biglia. Atletico Madrid forward Angel Correa, Benfica's Nicolas Gaitan, San Lorenzo defender Emmanuel Mas and River Plate's Matias Kranevitter have been called up to fill the gaps. Bolivia, meanwhile, will be playing their first game under new coach Julio Cesar Baldivieso. Mauricio Soria was in charge when the side reached the quarter-finals of the Copa America, but was sacked after falling out with the Bolivian FA. After a failed attempt to bring back Soria, Baldivies was given the job. Goalkeeper Romel Quinonez is absent due to a hand injury, but strikers Rodrigo Ramallo and Gilbert Alvarez have been called up. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"The remarkable rise of Pakistan match-winner Shakeel | Netherlands vs Pakistan World Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","Saud Shakeel was nowhere near World Cup selection three months ago but a thrilling half-century in Friday's win over the Netherlands underlined his remarkable and rapid rise up the cricketing ladder. Shakeel actually made his ODI debut in England in 2021 but he was largely out of the reckoning until he cracked an impressive double century in a Test in Sri Lanka in July. The diminutive 28-year-old, originally seen as a Test specialist, was included in Pakistan's squad for the three-match series against Afghanistan in August but he played only one match where he scored just nine. The team management, however, led by strategy and analytics manager Hasan Cheema and manager Rehan-ul Haq, backed him and convinced chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq to retain him for the Asia Cup. Pakistan crashed out of the tournament with defeats against India and Sri Lanka in the tournament. Perhaps not playing in a single match did Shakeel a favour -- he was included in the 15-man World Cup squad in place of allrounder Faheem Ashraf. Shakeel showed glimpses of what he can do in the warm-up match against New Zealand with a gritty 53-ball 75. On Friday, he became the toast of Pakistan's batting with an innings-reviving 52-ball 68 studded with a six and nine boundaries, guiding Pakistan to a fighting 282 after a precarious 38-3. ""I am very pleased to help my team win,"" said Shakeel at the post-match ceremony. ""I tried to follow my basics and be positive for my team despite having early nerves."" Shakeel added 120 for the fourth wicket with Mohammad Rizwan who also scored 68. Pakistan then dismissed the Netherlands for 205 in 41 overs to kick-start their World Cup campaign with an 81-run win. Shakeel admitted he was lucky at the start. ""I was lucky to get early boundaries,"" said the left-hander. ""We (with Rizwan) discussed that the pressure would transfer if we score, which did happen."" 'Next big star' Before his Test baptism against England in December last year, former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed had predicted Shakeel would make his mark. ""Shakeel has the skill and temperament to become a successful star,"" Sarfaraz said last year. ""Take my word, Shakeel will be the next big star for Pakistan."" Shakeel was the stand-out performer for Pakistan in an otherwise 3-0 annihilation by England who carried on their fiery Bazball approach of demolishing the opponents. Shakeel scored 346 in six innings -- second highest from Pakistan after Babar Azam's 348. An unbeaten maiden Test century against New Zealand in Karachi in January put him on track but the double hundred against Sri Lanka changed his Wold Cup fortunes. So consistent has been Shakeel's scoring that he became the first batter in Test cricket's 146-year history to pass 50 in each of his first seven Tests: his remarkable record, in fact, stands at six half-centuries and two centuries at a Bradmanesque average of 87.50. ""I've been working hard,"" said Shakeel. ""I knew I'd be batting No. 5, I tried to improve my shots, attacking options and be brave. The coaching staff has given me confidence."" And he duly dedicated his man-of-the-match award to his domestic team coach Hanif Malik. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"‘It is not my job to announce the winner’ | ENG vs NZ ICC WC 2023 | The Daily Star","England and New Zealand will face off once again in cricket's grandest stage in the opening match of the ICC ODI World Cup 2023 today with the 'Greatest final of all time' still fresh in memory. During captains' press conference in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma was asked whether England and New Zealand should have been named joint-winners after the Super-Over thriller in the World Cup 2019. ""It is not my job to decide that, sir. It is not my job to announce the winner"" said Rohit, who is known for his rib-tickling responses in press conferences and post-match interactions. India skipper, however, said he appreciates ""what's at stake"" but will not get bogged down by the weight of expectation on his team to win another World Cup title at home. The hosts begin their campaign against five-time champions Australia in Chennai on Sunday as cricket-crazy India looks to the team to end a long world title drought stretching back to the 2013 Champions Trophy. India last won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011 under M.S. Dhoni to add to their 1983 triumph in England. ""I know what's at stake, and so do the team members, the guys who are part of this team also know what's at stake,"" Rohit said at a captains' press conference in Ahmedabad. ""So, for us, it's just about taking everything out now and just focusing on what we want to do as a team. Not worry about the expectation because that's always going to be there."" He added: ""Not worry about who we're playing and not worry about what is happening elsewhere. Because it's time now for us to just be secluded a little bit, and then focus on what we want to do as a team."" Former captain and superstar batsman Virat Kohli took the team to great heights before he was replaced as the white-ball captain. Critics had often slammed Kohli for not winning a world crown. Rohit played down the pressure of leading a team followed by millions of home fans. ""All these guys are quite used to going through that pressure, whether it's playing in India or away from India,"" said Rohit. ""Pressure is something that is not going to leave a sportsman. As long as you are playing sport the pressure is always going to be there. Keep that aside, focus on the job at hand."" The last three editions of the showpiece event witnessed the home team taking the trophy in India (2011), Australia (2015) and England (2019). ""Not thinking too much about that,"" said Rohit ""It has happened in the last three editions of the World Cup, but all I can say is that we are going to try our best, give out best and enjoy the tournament."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

"De Kock, van der Dussen hit centuries | South Africa vs Sri Lanka LIVE Score | The Daily Star","Quinton de Kock and Rassie van der Dussen smashed centuries as South Africa headed towards an imposing total in their World Cup clash against Sri Lanka today, October 7. De Kock, who is playing in his final international tournament, hit his 18th ODI century off 83 balls with 12 fours and three sixes. De Kock put on 204 runs for the second wicket with van der Dussen before being dismissed off the next ball he faced after reaching 100, top edging a delivery from Matheesha Pathirana to Dhananjaya de Silva at mid-on. Van der Dussen soon reached his fifth century in the format off 103 balls with 12 fours and three sixes. De Kock and van der Dussen came together at the fall of the first wicket when skipper Temba Bavuma was trapped lbw by Dilshan Madushanka for just eight in the second over. Sri Lanka bowl first against South Africa Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bowl first in their World Cup clash against South Africa at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Saturday. Both sides arrived in India with injury setbacks. Sri Lanka, the 1996 champions, are missing leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga while off-break bowler Maheesh Theekshana is still unfit. South Africa were stripped of fast bowlers Sisanda Malanga and Anrich Nortje. The Proteas, who have never got beyond the semi-finals of the World Cup, named four fast bowlers in Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Marco Jansen and Gerald Coetzee with Keshav Maharaj taking on the main off-spinning role. The last time they played in New Delhi in 2022, South Africa were bowled out for 99.

"Kohli, Rahul lead India out of peril to beat Australia | The Daily Star","Virat Kohli and KL Rahul hit defiant knocks to lift India from a perilous three down for two runs to a six-wicket win over Australia in their opening Cricket World Cup match on Sunday. Chasing a tricky target of 200, India lost three batsmen, who all failed to score, inside two overs before Kohli (85) and Rahul (97 not out) put on 165. Victory was secured with 52 balls to spare. Spinner Ravindra Jadeja returned figures of 3-28 to help bowl out Australia for 199 in 49.3 overs in the 150th ODI meeting between the two cricket giants. Australia's fast bowlers then came out all guns blazing to rattle the Indian top-order after left-arm quick Mitchell Starc sent back Ishan Kishan for a duck in the first over. Josh Hazlewood struck twice in the next to remove skipper Rohit Sharma lbw and then Shreyas Iyer caught at cover also for nought to silence the home crowd of 32,531. Hazlewood nearly made it four down when he got Kohli to top-edge a delivery only for Mitchell Marsh to drop a skier. Kohli was on 12 at the time. Kohli made the most of the reprieve as the star batsman reached his 67th ODI half-century and raised his bat to acknowledge the loud cheers. Rahul soon reached his fifty in the 28th over as India went to 106-3 and in control. Kohli finally fell to Hazlewood caught out at mid-wicket and walked off to standing ovation. Rahul hit the winning six with Hardik Pandya at the other end. ""I had just taken a shower and was hoping to put my feet up for half an hour after the fielding innings, but I had to come in,"" said Rahul of his unexpectedly early arrival at the crease. ""Virat said that I should play like Test cricket for a bit."" Australia captain Pat Cummins admitted his team had been ""50 runs short"". ""Facing the spinners was tough and it was the kind of wicket you had to get yourself in."" Five-time champions Australia won the toss and elected to bat first but faltered. Jadeja stood out in his 10 overs of left-arm spin. Fellow spinner Kuldeep Yadav and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets each. Australia lost an early wicket before veteran batsmen David Warner (41) and Steve Smith (46) hit back in a partnership of 69. Kohli made an early impact with a diving slip catch to send back Marsh, for a six-ball duck, off Bumrah. The left-handed Warner reached 1,000 World Cup runs, passing Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar's previous best landmark. Warner needed 19 innings to Tendulkar's 20. Kuldeep, a left-arm wrist spinner, broke the stand to send back Warner, caught and bowled. Jadeja bowled Smith to deny the former captain his fifty and then struck twice in his next over including wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey for a duck to rattle the opposition batting. Australia collapsed from 110-2 to 140-7 before Cummins hit the first six of the match, but fell for 15. Number nine Mitchell Starc hit 28 to add some respect to the total. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Shanaka ruled out of World Cup with injury | The Daily Star","Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka has been ruled out of the rest of the ICC ODI World Cup 2023 with a quad injury, ICC said in a press release today. The all-rounder has been replaced in the squad by Chamika Karunaratne, who was travelling with the Sri Lanka squad as a reserve player. Shanaka injured his right thigh muscle during Sri Lanka's match against Pakistan on Tuesday. The 32-year-old was later taken for scans which revealed that it will take him a minimum of three weeks to recover. Shanaka's injury is a big blow for Sri Lanka, who are already in a tough spot after losing their first two matches in the tournament. Karunaratne, who has played 23 ODIs, hasn't played a 50-over game for Sri Lanka since this year's March. Sri Lanka's next match in the World Cup is against Australia in Lucknow on Monday. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Shakib leads batting disappointment | New Zealand Beat Bangladesh By 8 wickets | The Daily Star","Soft dismissals, unforced errors have led to the demise of the Bangladesh top-order in recent times, and it was no exception against New Zealand in their third ICC World Cup fixture in Chennai yesterday. It was not uncommon to see the Bangladesh top four batter sent packing inside 13 overs, given it marked the seventh instance in the last 10 ODIs where Bangladesh went on to lose four wickets before reaching three figures. But what followed, after skipper Shakib Al Hasan steadied the ship Mushfiqur Rahim, was the most frustrating from the Bangladesh perspective. Veterans with five World Cup experience, Shakib and Mushfiqur did make their experience count somewhat, but the job was far from done for the two Bangladesh stalwarts when the former faltered. At 145 for four after 29 overs, knowing that they have a long tail, the situation required Shakib and Mushfiqur to play sensibly for another five to six overs to lay the platform of a near 270. A while earlier, Shakib had suffered a cramp and he proceeded without wearing a cap or a helmet in a never-before-seen act from the ace all-rounder. While it was not surprising to see the Bangladesh skipper opting to aim for the boundaries to compensate for his compromised running ability, his overtly aggressive approach did not reflect his wealth of experience. Following drinks break, spinner Rachin Ravindra was on the receiving end of a four and a six from Shakib. The next over, a top-edge off a Lockie Ferguson delivery resulted in a six over backward square leg as Shakib reached forty but he paid the price next ball, having played one shot too many. Eventually, Mushfiqur Rahim's 66 and a rearguard action from seasoned campaigner Mahmudullah Riyad, who scored an unbeaten 49-ball 41 on his first appearance in the ongoing event, gave their bowlers something to defend. Going back to the innings' start, Liton Das chose to mark his birthday with a golden duck, caught at deep fine leg, and that too in the first delivery of the innings bowled by Trent Boult. Bangladesh, thus, were on the back foot from the onset on what turned out to be a batting-friendly surface. And despite all the noise that the surface at the MA Chidambaram stadium was primed to be a spinner's paradise, New Zealand pacers eventually shared seven of nine scalps. Bangladesh batters can only blame themselves at the end of day. Young Tanzid Hasan Tamim timed a flick and found the fielder at the in-field after a promising 16 off 17 balls, while in-form Mehedi Hasa Miraz, in at number three, departed in similar fashion to Liton after a well-compiled 30. The worst fear was coming true for Bangladesh, it seemed, once Najmul Hossain Shanto – who averaged 80-plus in last five ODIs – was the next to get out following another soft dismissal against the run of play. This time, off-spinner Glenn Phillips found his victim without much effort. Apart from Mushfiqur, who fell to Matt Henry's brilliantly executed slower delivery that bounced low, none of the top six Bangladesh batters looked like they were up for an occasion of World Cup's magnitude. The execution was vividly lacking on the day, but the team management's decision to keep shuffling the top-order is also bound to come under heavy scrutiny. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"De Leede ready for New Zealand versions of Shaheen, Rauf | Netherlands vs Pakistan World Cup 2023 | The Daily Star","Dutch all-rounder Bas de Leede believes New Zealand seamers Trent Boult and Lockie Ferguson will pose the same dangers as Pakistan's vaunted pace duo Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf when they meet in the World Cup on Monday. The Netherlands slipped to an 81-run defeat to Pakistan in their championship opener on Friday with Shaheen, Rauf and Hasan Ali claiming six wickets between them. Now the Dutch, the only second-tier Associate team at the 10-nation World Cup, must bounce back against the Kiwis who started their campaign with a thumping nine-wicket rout of champions England on Thursday. ""There's Trent Boult, who is similar to Shaheen probably. Lockie Ferguson probably similar to Haris Rauf,"" said De Leede. ""So, a lot of similarities. We'll take our learnings from this game and then try and adapt for the next game."" The Dutch were well-placed to chase down a target of 287 to win on Friday when they stood at 120-2 in the 24th over with De Leede (67) and Vikramjit Singh (52) together. However, they lost three quick wickets for the addition of just 13 runs and never recovered before being bowled out for 205. Pakistan had earlier been indebted to innings of 68 each from Saud Shakeel and Mohammad Rizwan. ""I think it was those wickets that were our downfall,"" said 23-year-old De Leede. ""We lost Vikram, then Teja (Nidamanuru), then lost Scott Edwards in quite a quick couple of overs, which put us on the back foot. ""It's tough to then go on and put up another partnership and try and win the game."" De Leede was the star for his team with the ball as well, taking 4-62. He said he sought out tips on how to bat on slow, spinning tracks of India. ""I spoke to a couple of people who have experience here and asked them what they think overseas batters needed to do to succeed against spin in India,"" said De Leede. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Tigers surrender to Kiwi short ball barrage | The Daily Star","For a moment, imagine that you didn't see Friday's World Cup match between Bangladesh and New Zealand. Someone tells you that one of the teams got restricted to 245 after batting the entire 50 overs in Chennai. If you had been following the reports from local media leading up to the match, you most likely would have presumed that this was the result of spinners once again ruling the roost in Chennai. If you are a fan of Bangladesh cricket, you had probably hoped that it was the Tigers who had strangled the Kiwis with their spin attack as expectations were that the ball would turn square at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, much like it did during the World Cup match between India and Australia. However, a quick glance at the scorecard shows that none of the spinners were able to leave their mark in the game – neither from Bangladesh nor from New Zealand, as on Friday, the Kiwi pacers stole the show. The nature of the pitch came as a surprise for the fans. But both teams had read the pitch beforehand which was apparent from their playing XIs. New Zealand didn't drop a pacer to play an extra spinner while Bangladesh dropped spinner Mahedi Hasan for batter Mahmudullah. Express pacer Lockie Ferguson kept darting in lethal bouncers aimed at the heads of the Bangladesh batters. Other Kiwi pacers -- Trent Boult and Matt Henry -- also kept pitching the ball short. They did so, responding to the different nature of the wicket. India availed the home advantage against Australia and stung them on a spin friendly 22 yards. The Bangladesh-New Zealand match happened at the same ground but on a different pitch, where there was bounce on offer for the pacers. Kiwi pacers took full advantage of the licence to bowl two short balls in an over as they fulfilled that quota in seemingly every over. Commentator Sanjay Manjrekar pointed out 56 percent of the balls delivered by the New Zealand pacers were pitched in short. According to ESPNcricinfo, 45 of Ferguson's 60 legal deliveries in the match were pitched either in the short length area or short of a good length. Let's take a look at the 12th over of the Bangladesh innings for example. Ferguson bowled a bouncer in the second delivery, the following ball was also a bouncer but was declared a wide for height. Just one ball later, Ferguson again pitched the ball short. And this time, Mehedi Hasan Miraz fell into his trap and offered a catch at fine-leg. The same tactic was applied against Mushfiqur Rahim. But he handled that line of attack very well, even hitting a few boundaries. But skipper Shakib Al Hasan lost his wicket to a short-pitched delivery. Bangladesh batters are susceptible against short pitch bowling. As per ESPNcricinfo, Bangladesh batter have a strike rate of 85 against that type of bowling in the past two years -- the lowest among all teams in the World Cup. The Tigers are also amongst the three teams with the lowest average against short balls. In the post-match presentation ceremony, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said they decided to adopt the short-ball approach midway into the first Powerplay. Ferguson said there was more bounce on offer in Chennai compared to Hyderabad, where New Zealand had played their previous two matches in the World Cup. New Zealand bowled 31 overs of pace, where they claimed seven wickets for 163 runs. Their pacers averaged 23.28, which is the best amongst all pace attacks in Chennai in the past 10 years in matches where the pacers have at least claimed five wickets. Bangladesh pacers, on the other hand, had a comical average of 135 -- the worst ever in Chennai in matches where teams had bowled at least 20 overs of pace. The Bangladesh quicks bowled 23.5 overs, gave away 135 runs and took just one wicket. In the end, the match wasn't a battle between spin attacks, as the media had speculated. It was a game where New Zealand unleashed a short ball barrage and the Bangladesh batters meekly surrendered. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"De Kock, bowlers hand Australia 134-run defeat | The Daily Star","South Africa crushed Australia by 134 runs to claim a second win of the World Cup on Thursday as the five-time champions slumped to back-to-back defeats. Quinton de Kock top-scored for the Proteas with 109 in his team's total of 311-7 in 50 overs. In reply, Australia slumped to 70-6 before giving up their pursuit of an unlikely victory, hoping to salvage their run-rate instead but were dismissed for 177 with 55 balls to spare. Earlier, De Kock reached his 19th ODI hundred off 90 balls with eight fours and five sixes having also made a century in South Africa's opening win over Sri Lanka. De Kock, who will retire from international cricket at the end of the tournament, was batting in familiar surroundings at the Ekana Stadium where he plays in the IPL for the Lucknow Super Giants. He was eventually dismissed for 109, bowled by off-spinner Glenn Maxwell while trying to reverse sweep in the 35th over. South Africa were on 197-3 at the time before Aiden Markram then took up the charge. Having made the fastest World Cup century off just 49 balls in the win over Sri Lanka, Markram raced to 56, making the most of being dropped by Australia skipper Pat Cummins when he had made just a single. It was a miserable day in the field for Australia as South Africa captain Temba Bavuma was also dropped twice on 19 and 32. Mitchell Marsh dropped Virat Kohli in their opening game when the Indian star was on 12. Kohli went on to make a match-winning 85. Bavuma's luck ran out on 35 when he was caught at midwicket by David Warner off Maxwell. With De Kock, the skipper put on 108 for the first wicket. Once Markram was dismissed by Cummins, the Proteas saw Marco Jansen (26) and David Miller (17) take them past the 300 mark. Both Miller and Jansen fell in the final over, a double-wicket maiden bowled by Mitchell Starc. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Rohit’s slow footwork makes him vulnerable, says Gavaskar | IND vs AUS | The Daily Star","Indian cricket great Sunil Gavaskar said that Rohit Sharma's slow footwork makes him vulnerable early on in the innings and the opener needs to rectify this issue if he wants to replicate what he did in the previous edition of the World Cup. In the 2019 ODI World Cup, Rohit finished as the highest run-getter, scoring 648 runs with five centuries and a half-century. The Indian captain, however, started his campaign in the 2023 edition with a duck against Australia in Chennai. Gavaskar in his column for Sportstar, dissected Rohit's dismissal and said the 36-year-old's slow footwork was the reason why he got trapped Leg Before Wicket (LBW) by Josh Hazlewood. ""In the last tournament in 2019, Rohit Sharma, the Indian skipper, hit five centuries and a few half-centuries too. This time around, which could well be his last World Cup, he has begun with a zero in the first game,"" Gavaskar wrote. ""The footwork is palpably slow to start with, and that makes him vulnerable to the incoming delivery. If he can rediscover the 2019 form, then India will be assured of a very good start to their campaign,"" he added. India eventually won the match by six wickets but it wasn't smooth sailing for the hosts. Chasing just 200, India had lost three wickets for just two runs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. KL Rahul then hit an unbeaten 97 and Virat Kohli, who got dropped on 12, made 85 to ensure the hosts began their campaign with a victory.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"The top order needs to bat more responsibly: Shanto | NZ vs BAN | The Daily Star","Bangladesh ODI vice-captain Najmul Hossain Shanto lamented his side's top-order batting on a good wicket as they went down in a comprehensive eight-wicket defeat at the hands of New Zealand at the Chepauk in Chennai on Friday. Shanto, who came in at four on the day, was one of the batters to blame as Bangladesh's first four batters were back in the hut for 56 within the 13th over of the first innings. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan and veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim tried to put a band-aid on the already dented batting effort with a 96-run stand but it wasn't enough to pull the Tigers out of their batting rut that produced yet another sorry display, managing just 245 for nine on a good surface. ""We didn't bat well, same as the last match. We need to improve in the first 15 overs. There was a bit of extra bounce with the new ball but after that the wicket was quiet. The top order needs to bat more responsibly. It was a good wicket, so we just needed to be a bit more responsible at the start,"" Shanto said in the post-match interview. ""In the last match, we didn't bowl well but today everyone showed their character. If they continue like this it will be very good going forward. The biggest improvement is our fast bowling, if we bat well in the next few games it will be a different ball game,"" he added. The top-order tumble started with Liton Das's baffling approach that saw him charge Trent Boult on the very first delivery of the innings. The right-handed batter, who scored a fifty in his previous match, clipped it straight to deep fine-leg to continue his hit-or-miss performance at the top. His partner Tanzid Tamim followed soon. He chipped a full-length ball off his legs straight to Lockie Ferguson at square leg. What should've been a bread-and-butter shot for any top-order player made its way into the hands of the only fielder guarding that side of the ground. Next up was Mehedi Hasan Miraz, who looked impressive and at ease for his 46-ball 30 before he went out of character and tried to hook Ferguson over deep fine-leg. Not the most natural of pullers nor hookers, Miraz went for the shot against a Ferguson, who was spearing it through at an excess of 140 km/p, anyways and that too towards the longer part of the ground. In-form Shanto couldn't help either, perishing when he scooped one to short extra cover on the very first delivery that off-spinner Glenn Phillips had bowled. This similar scenario managed to pull down Bangladesh's chance at a fighting total, a case that the Tigers are quite familiar with. Bangladesh were bundled out for 227 while chasing 364 for nine in their previous match against England in Dharamshala.

"Shakib Al Hasan Injured: Shakib injury scare in heavy defeat | The Daily Star","Bangladesh were potentially handed a double blow on Friday as the Tigers saw skipper Shakib Al Hasan walk off the field with an injury in their heavy eight-wicket defeat against New Zealand at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai yesterday. Shakib strained his left quad while batting and could not field till the end of the game. He was taken for a scan. ""Shakib has gone for a scan. So, we will know more [about it] after that,"" said Bangladesh batter Najmul Hossain Shanto on Shakib's injury during the post-match presentation ceremony. Meanwhile, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson marked his return to the World Cup with an undefeated 78 but the Kiwi captain also saw his involvement in the game cut short due to an injury. Chasing 246 to win, Williamson, playing his first ODI since January after being sidelined due to a knee injury, had reached his 43rd fifty in the format off 81 balls. He moved on to 78 with eight fours and a six when he had to call it quits after a throw from the deep rapped him painfully on the glove. But New Zealand comfortably wrapped up their third win with 43 balls to spare. Williamson had put on a second-wicket stand of 80 with opener Devon Conway (45) and then 108 with Daryl Mitchell who scored an unbeaten 89.

"India vs Pakistan: Pakistan keen to break India jinx | The Daily Star","Pakistan would be forgiven for feeling like gladiators thrown into the Colosseum when they face an India team egged on by 100,000-plus fans in Saturday's World Cup blockbuster, but skipper Babar Azam sees the match as a chance to end a jinx against their arch-rivals. Two-time champions India have a perfect 7-0 record against Pakistan in the 50-overs World Cup and are also the top-ranked ODI team, who have won both their games in the tournament so far. But Pakistan have also won their opening two matches, and Babar is approaching the tournament's most-anticipated clash at the Narendra Modi Stadium, the world's largest cricket venue, with a complete disregard for the past. ""I don't think about the past, I'd rather focus on future,"" Babar told reporters with a wry smile on his face. ""All records are meant to be broken, and we'll try to break this record tomorrow. ""It boils down to how you perform on the day of the match. We have done pretty well in the first two matches, and I have full belief we'll do well in the next match as well."" Part of how they perform will depend on how his team mates manage to deal with the pressure of the game's fiercest rivalry played out in the den of their cricketing foes. Babar said his message to his team mates was to see it as an opportunity to perform well and etch their names into the memories of those watching back home.  ""India-Pakistan match is a big game, a high-intensity contest. I've told my boys it's a great opportunity - give your best, execute your plans and believe in yourself,"" he said. ""It's a massive stadium, and there would be big crowd. This is a golden opportunity for us to perform in front of such a big crowd."" Pakistan's fortunes could depend on pace spearhead Shaheen Afridi, who has troubled India's top order in recent encounters between the rivals. His workload has increased after his new-ball partner Naseem Shah was ruled out of the tournament with a shoulder injury but Babar has faith in Afridi. ""He's our best bowler, a champion bowler,"" Babar said of the left-arm quick. ""I believe he's a big-match bowler, who always gives his best on big occasions. ""For us, it does not matter if he does not get wickets in a match or two, it does not put a question mark against him."" With this year's tournament producing several high-scoring contests, Babar said he had reminded the bowlers of the need to be accurate. ""We are seeing mostly high-scoring matches and there's little margin for error for the bowlers. If you are straying from the stumps line, the margin is less.

"‘The host nation are slight favourites in big tournaments’ | The Daily Star","Australian captain Aaron Finch admitted his team was ""tired"" and needed to freshen up before their defence of the Twenty20 World Cup title, but England skipper Jos Buttler on Saturday said the hosts remain the favourites. The reigning champions head into the showpiece cricket tournament on home soil, which starts Sunday with the preliminary round after a lacklustre three-match series against the English. They lost 2-0, with the third game abandoned Friday evening due to rain, culminating eight matches for Australia in 26 days -- three of them in India. ""I think the guys are probably a little bit tired at the moment,"" Finch said after the washed-out England match, where he fell for a first-ball duck. ""The schedule has been so packed over the last six to eight weeks that we identified a couple of months ago that we wanted to make sure that we're in a position to be peaking at the right time of the World Cup and not beforehand. ""So it's going to be important over the next couple of days to try and freshen everyone up as much as we can."" Buttler, whose team are riding high after a confidence-boosting build-up, insisted Australia were still the team to beat. ""T20 is one of those games that can be unpredictable, but I think history tells you that, generally, the host nation are slight favourites in big tournaments,"" he said in Melbourne. ""Many of us have travelled and played in Australia and know the conditions, but of course no-one is going to know the conditions or be as accustomed to them as the Australian team. ""They are also reigning champions, so you have to pick them out probably as favourites for the tournaments."" Australia still has an unofficial warm-up game scheduled against India before they enter the World Cup at the Super 12 stage on October 22 in a rematch of last year's final with New Zealand. Finch said the players would be given a couple of off days in the lead-up ""where there's no cricket at all to let our guys recharge"". He also acknowledged that England ""definitely outplayed us"". ""With the bat, we were always just one wicket down further than we needed to be over the whole series,"" he said. ""In big run chases, you need that one in batter towards the back of the innings and we probably were just falling a little bit short each time with that.

"Tigers get new lease on life as SA stumble | The Daily Star","The Netherlands sent South Africa crashing out of the Twenty20 World Cup on Sunday with a stunning 13-run victory in Adelaide which also propelled India into the semi-finals. The latest in a series of shocks at this tournament left Bangladesh and Pakistan fighting it out for the final spot in the last four. Table-toppers India are on six points and play Zimbabwe in Melbourne in the final match of Sunday's triple header, the result of which will decide the final Super 12 standings and who faces whom in the semis. Chasing 159 for victory after Colin Ackermann's unbeaten 41, South Africa faltered to end on 145-8, with Dutch fast bowler Brandon Glover returning impressive figures of 3-9 in two overs. South Africa started on a jittery note with openers Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma out inside six overs with the score on 39. The left-handed de Kock hit a four and six but soon fell caught behind to Fred Klaassen, for 13, and Bavuma was bowled by Paul van Meekeren for 20. But it was Glover's wicket of Rilee Rossouw that raised the Dutch hopes with the batsman, who hit the first century in this tournament, departing after a 19-ball 25. The Proteas never looked convincing as Klaassen took down Aiden Markram for 17 and a Dutch shock started becoming a reality when Glover struck twice in one over. He sent back the dangerous David Miller and then got Wayne Parnell caught behind as the wheels came off the South Africa chase -- and with it their World Cup hopes. Put in to bat first, the Dutch, who had only beaten Zimbabwe in the Super 12, started strongly with Stephan Myburgh's 37 but lost their way. But then stepped in Ackermann. He hit three fours and two sixes in his 26-ball knock and along with skipper Scott Edwards helped the team get 31 runs from the final two overs. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"India thrashing 'counts for nothing' in final: Buttler | The Daily Star","Skipper Jos Buttler says the emphatic way England crushed India to reach Sunday's Twenty20 World Cup final ""doesn't count for anything"" as they bid to become champions in both white-ball formats. India were humbled by 10 wickets in the semi-finals with Buttler's composed 80 and Alex Hales's blistering 86 setting up a blockbuster showdown with Babar Azam's Pakistan. The England opener said Saturday there was ""a huge amount of excitement"" for the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, although it could be affected by rain. A reserve day has been set aside on Monday, but the forecast is equally gloomy. England continue to have injury worries over Dawid Malan and fast bowler Mark Wood, who both missed Thursday's semi-final. Buttler said they were ""both improving"". ""Obviously there's not many days since the semi-final, but we are giving them every chance,"" he added. Phil Salt and Chris Jordan are again the likely replacements should they not recover. Despite the weather and injury concerns, Buttler was in buoyant mood in his pre-match press conference. ""Any time you get a chance to play in a World Cup final is a huge honour. We're really excited as a group, there's a nice feel around the team,"" he said. ""The previous performance (against India) gives us a lot of confidence, but it doesn't count for anything. ""Tomorrow we start a fresh game against a really tough opposition and any time you are fighting for a trophy you know it isn't going to come easy. ""So we will focus on them a little bit and on us a lot and what we need to do to prepare well today to turn up tomorrow and do the best we can."" England head into the game as the current one-day world champions after their 2019 triumph at home against New Zealand. Buttler was on the winning team, as were Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid and Wood, all stalwarts of the side now in the T20 World Cup final. He said the experience of winning a world title would help them on Sunday. ""Yes, I think any experiences you can draw on, good or bad, you will have learned from those and can reflect on those when you are in a situation of adversity or chaos,"" he said. ""Those are things that can happen in a World Cup final so the more experience and being able to understand those feelings and how to react to them, I definitely see that as a benefit."" - Fantastic team - While England's batting runs deep, how they fare could come down to the top order fending off the threat posed by Pakistan pace spearheads Mohammad Nawaz and Shaheen Shah Afridi. Pakistan bouncing back after losing their opening World Cup matches to India and Zimbabwe was largely down to the starts given by their new-ball attack. They have the second-best economy rate at the tournament in the six-over powerplay, a factor Buttler is aware of. ""They have a fantastic team who have a very long history of producing excellent fast bowlers, and I see the team we are up against as no different,"" said Buttler. ""I'm sure by the end of their careers some of the players we are playing against will go down as some of the best Pakistan have produced.

"‘Afridi holds the key for Pakistan progressing in the tournament’ | The Daily Star","Australia great Ricky Ponting has declared speedster Shaheen Afridi as the player that must fire if Pakistan are to claim a second ICC Men's T20 World Cup title in Australia. Afridi produced his best performance of the tournament so far when he bowled with supreme pace and collected superb figures of 4/22 against Bangladesh on Sunday and that spell helped Pakistan earn the final spot in the semi-finals of the tournament. Pakistan have a meeting against an in-form New Zealand awaiting them at the SCG on Wednesday and Ponting said Afridi is the key player in that contest. ""He might say that he's not back to 100 percent just yet, but from what I've seen it looks like he's going along beautifully and he now holds the key for Pakistan progressing in the tournament,"" Ponting said. Afridi hurt his right knee while fielding during the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle in July and the 22-year-old admitted his recovery was slow as he could barely walk following the injury. There may have been some doubts raised about Afrdi's swift return when he went wicketless during Pakistan's opening two games of the tournament against India and Zimbabwe, but Ponting always had faith the left-armer would come good. ""(I never had any doubt) as you just know what he's capable of when he's out there on the field,"" Ponting said. ""And as I said, even if he's not at 100 percent, if he's operating at 90 percent, he's still going to have more of an impact on games than most because of how good he is. ""So look, he might have had a few worries in the back of his own mind and the Pakistan hierarchy and coaching group might have had a few worries in their mind, but not anymore. ""He's got through really well so far and hopefully for them two more games to go."" Ponting compared Afridi's return to form to the way India superstar Virat Kohli had sprung to life in Australia and indicated sometimes you just need to put your faith in the champion players to produce on the big stage. ""It's almost a bit like the India scenario with Virat (Kohli) coming into this tournament,"" Ponting noted. ""Sometimes you just have to stick with them and pick them and let them go because champion players will find a way to get the job done. ""And as the tournament's gone on he (Afridi) has got better and better and hopefully the best is still to come."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Afridi calls on Babar Azam to move down the order | The Daily Star","Pakistan skipper Babar Azam should stand aside and give Mohammad Haris his opener slot to boost their top order firepower in Wednesday's Twenty20 World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, former captain Shahid Afridi said. Pakistan, the 2009 champions, looked set to exit the competition until the Netherlands pulled off a major upset by beating South Africa on Sunday. Mohammad Rizwan and Babar went into the tournament ranked as the top two T20 batters but neither has managed a fifty in the tournament so far. Rizwan has scored at a run-a-ball rate while Babar, Pakistan's premier batsman, has a strike rate of 61.90. Both will have to up their game against last year's runners-up New Zealand in the first semi-final in Sydney. India play England in the second semi in Adelaide on Thursday. ""Babar Azam needs to listen to suggestions,"" former all-rounder Afridi told Samaa TV. ""We need to use Mohammad Haris with fielding restrictions. Babar Azam should drop to number three."" Afridi said Pakistan's top order should play with more intent and be as aggressive as middle order batters Iftikhar Ahmed and Shan Masood. ""You look at Iftikhar or Shan Masood and you can see their intention in their body language, that they are looking to hit the ball. We need that kind of intention, that kind of cricket.

"India, Sri Lanka eye Asian crown | The Daily Star","Rohit Sharma's India face underdogs Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final, a crucial momentum-builder heading into next month's ODI World Cup. The cricketing giants have 13 Asian titles between them and Sri Lanka have a history of sneaking into the tournament's final -- to the consternation of fans keen for any showdown between arch-rivals India and Pakistan. Bangladesh ended India's unbeaten run in the 50-over tournament after edging them out by six runs in Friday's last Super Four match. Shubman Gill hit 121 but his knock went in vain after India faltered in their chase of 266 in Colombo, where Sunday's final will also be held. ""I don't think it has broken our momentum,"" Gill told reporters after the narrow defeat. ""We have played good cricket. Sometimes it happens on these wickets. I was set and should have finished off the game."" Gill said clinching India's eighth Asia Cup title would give them ""confidence"" ahead of the World Cup starting back home on October 5. India began with a washed-out match in Pallekele against Pakistan, whose fast bowlers rattled their top order and bowled them out for 266 in the only innings possible due to rain. Big guns Virat Kohli and returning batsman KL Rahul hit back with centuries in their next outing against Babar Azam's team to rack up 356-2 and crush Pakistan by 228 runs. India then prevented a gutsy Sri Lankan chase to book their place in the final, but Gill said their opponents were still a threat. ""We will have to pull up our socks and be at our 100 percent to beat them,"" he said. Sri Lanka, who won the previous edition of the Asia Cup played in the T20 format, came in as underdogs and snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan. They soon got into their groove on home soil and, despite going down to India, edged out Pakistan in a knockout match for their 11th Asia Cup final. ""We came without our key players, but still we managed to make the finals,"" skipper Dasun Shanaka said. Injuries sidelined Dushmantha Chameera and Wanindu Hasaranga, but others stood up at crucial junctures. Kusal Mendis and Charith Asalanka both hit match-winning knocks to take the team over the line in a rain-shortened match and push a much-favoured Pakistan out of the tournament. Up-and-coming fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana and left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage have impressed and lead the tournament's bowling chart with 11 and 10 wickets respectively. Wellalage rattled India's batting with five wickets including the prized scalps of Kohli and Rohit in their Super Four match. Twice before in the Asia Cup Sri Lanka have lost to India in the Super Four stage only to beat them in the finals, in 2004 and 2008. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

"Tanzid, Bijoy back in the hut as Tigers are three down | The Daily Star","Bangladesh opener Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Anamul Haque Bijoy got dismissed in quick succession to leave the Tigers at three down for 29 runs after six overs against India in their Asia Cup Super Four contest at the R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday. Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan came in at four, while Mehedi Hasan Miraz came to bat at five. Tamim, who was left out after the Tigers' first game against Sri Lanka in the ongoing edition of the tournament, couldn't make his second shot at opening the innings count as he played one onto the stumps while trying to pull a short-of-a-good-length delivery bowled by India pacer Shardul Thakur in the fourth over. He looked good for his 12-ball 13 as he put away three boundaries but failed to capitalise on his start. Playing in his first ODI since December 2022, Anamul Haque Bijoy threw his wicket away in a manner that made many scratch their heads. In the fourth over, Anamul pulled Shardul for a boundary in the second delivery of the sixth over. The next ball was a yorker that he fended after which he looked to pull across a good-length delivery outside off-stump but failed to get anywhere near to make proper contact. All he could do is concede a top-dge that scooped up and fell into the hadns of wicketkeeper KL Rahul. His lacklustre knock lasted for 11 balls off which he managed four runs that came from a solitary boundary. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

The win brought the Tigers their first-ever win in Colombo but it only came as a consolation as the Shakib Al Hasan-led side had already exited the competition. The Tigers bundled out India for 259 after posting 265 for eight having being sent to bat first. India opener Shubman Gill notched up his fifth ODI ton that saw him smash five sixes and eight fours in his 133-ball 121 that almost took the game away from Bangladesh. Axar Patel's 34-ball 42 almost took India to the brink of victory late on in the game but Mustafizur Rahman outfoxed him with a trademark cutter in the 49th over to take the Tigers on the shores of victory. The Fizz picked up three wickets for 50 runs, with two of the scalps coming in the 49th over, while Sheikh Mahedi Hasan and debutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib scalped two wickets each.

"It’s like a dream, says Siraj | The Daily Star","India kept their best reserved, or, Sri Lanka their worst, for Sunday's one-sided final of the Asia Cup, a tournament played as a prelude to the World Cup in India next month. With the game lasting a total of 129 deliveries, the third-shortest in terms of balls bowled in ODIs, the Rohit Sharma-led side not only portrayed their ruthlessness but also sent a warning to nine other nations who would be travelling to their home for the World Cup in less than a month's time. The destroyer in chief yesterday was Mohammad Siraj, only the fourth bowler to take four wickets in an over in ODIs. After breaking the backbone of the Lankan batting lineup with the wickets of Pathum Nissanka, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka, and Dhananjaya de Silva in the fourth over to have the co-hosts reeling at 12 for five in Colombo, Siraj went on to finish with career-best figures of six for 21 in seven overs, including a maiden. ""It's like a dream,"" Siraj said during the innings break. ""I got four early wickets last time I played Sri Lanka (earlier this year) but unfortunately I could not register a five-wicket haul. ""I realised you get whatever is in your destiny. I just tried to bowl my line and length, and wickets kept coming. ""The ball did not swing much in the early matches here but today it swung a lot. My effort was to draw the batters forward and make them play the ball,"" Siraj added. Siraj also credited his pace-bowling partners Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya, who accounted for one and three wickets, respectively. ""I was missing the edges earlier but found them today. The wicket was seaming earlier, but there was swing today. When there's good bonding between fast bowlers, it's helpful for the team,"" Siraj said. Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood bemoaned his team's ""below-par"" performance with the bat, probably hinting at making some adjustments when they announce the 15 for the World Cup. Sri Lanka played the tournament without four of their regular starters. ""The way we got dismissed is very disappointing. I think there's a lot of reflection to be done in the dressing room. I think we need to sleep on this and make some decisions tomorrow, best to assess this in the morning and discuss with the other coaching staff as well.,"" he said. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

"Of flickering flames and misleading hype | The Daily Star","Prior to the 16th edition of Asia Cup, the continent's biggest cricket event, there were high hopes surrounding three-time finalists Bangladesh. The Tigers, however, only returned home with a comprehensive victory over Afghanistan and a consolation win over India. Yet, the latter came as more than a consolation to the team management as it gave Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan and coach Chandika Hathurusingha enough confidence to present an optimistic picture ahead of the World Cup. While Shakib warned after India's triumph that they will be ""a dangerous side in the World Cup"", Chandika labelled it as ""huge"" boost for the Tigers heading into the showpiece event. Bangladesh began their campaign with a demoralising loss against Sri Lanka, but bounced back strongly against Afghanistan to earn a Super Four spot. The ghost of their opening match's batting debacle resurfaced in the first two Super Four matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka, prompting Shakib to remark, ""We really needed this reality check before the World Cup"". It was undoubtedly refreshing as Shakib and co regained their confidence following a nail-biting six-run win against India, who rested important players such as Virat Kohli and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the dead rubber. A thrilling win against India is always pleasant, and it was great to see skipper Shakib finally leading from the front in the tournament, earning the player-of-the-match award in the process. The most satisfying scene was the performance of a young pacer, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, in his maiden game. If his first spell suggests a promising future, his composure in the last over will be remembered for a long time. Nothing was wrong with Hathurusingha heaping praise on unlikely heroes in Mahedi Hasan and Nasum Ahmed, who stood up to give team management food for thought as they look to finalise World Cup squad by September 28. Moreover, Shakib commended Towhid Hridoy the other day, and the batter deserved it. Another player worthy of praise is Mehedi Hasan Miraz who strengthened his reputation as a utility cricketer. As a team, though, the Tigers fell short of their goals for the event. Their performance did not live up to the claim, made by the head coach, of being ""one of the best sides in its history"". If we recall what Hathurusingha remarked to broadcasters earlier this year, we must conclude that the Tigers were underachievers. ""We have started the road map for the Asia Cup, Bangladesh's side is among the best in its history. We have the best opportunity to do something that Bangladesh haven't done before,"" said the Bangladesh coach before the third day of play in the one-off Test between Bangladesh and Afghanistan in Mirpur in June. But Bangladesh's team resorted to come up with a defence for their inconsistent show. Shakib stated after the India match, ""Lots of injuries, and players coming in and out didn't help during this Asia Cup."" Injury setbacks, now a normal occurrence in world cricket, cannot be an excuse for a side who claimed to be one of the best sides in their history. A team cannot prosper in a global event unless it has a greater pool of players, as Sri Lanka does, contending for a spot in the eleven. While speaking to local media prior to their departure to Sri Lanka, Shakib refused to correlate Asia Cup displays to the World Cup; although he did say that they may take confidence from excellent performances in the continental event. The all-rounder also stated that they will not be discouraged if they do not perform well in the Asia Cup, adding, ""Even if we do well, it does not mean our chances for the World Cup will improve."" It is worth pointing out that a win against India may restore Bangladesh's confidence to some extent, but it doesn't imply that lingering batting problems, particularly in the top and death overs, will be forgotten. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

Still, the delays in obtaining an Indian visa, the arduous nature of the journey and managing personal matters make this lengthy trip a very difficult one. During Bangladesh's match against Afghanistan, there were many Bangladeshi fans at the stands and all of them had a story to tell about their journey. But among them, Fahim's story stood out. Fahim is a software engineer employed in Dhaka. He regularly turns up at the stadium to watch Bangladesh play at home. This is the first time he has gone abroad to watch the Tigers play and he had planned this trip well in advance. ""I've been watching matches from the ground since 2012. I've watched 30-40 matches till now. I've always watched matches at home, never gone abroad for a match. When it was announced that the 2023 World Cup will be played in India, I thought to myself that as this was happening in the neighbouring country, so I must go and see the World Cup,"" Fahim said. When Fahim made the decision, he was still a student. But he didn't let go of his dream when he joined the workforce. ""Two years ago, I joined Vivasoft Ltd as a software engineer. When I joined, the company's management communicated its rules and regulations, and they asked if I had anything to say. That's when I told them that during the 2023 World Cup, I would require a 30-40-day vacation. Seeing my craze for cricket, they accepted my condition,"" Fahim said. ""I got more and more anxious as the World Cup drew closer. I had applied for a visa three months ago. But everything was moving at such a slow pace that even a month ago I thought I wouldn't be able to go to India.""  Another Bangladeshi cricket fan, Mahfuz Siddique Himalay, plans to visit 18 Indian cities on this tour. He will watch five matches of the Bangladesh team from the stands and spend the rest of his trip observing the Indian culture, heritage, history and architecture. He will write about it on social media and also author a book on his tour. His well-wishers came up with the funds for his 46-day trip. He posted on Facebook for support for his tour to India, which got a tremendous response. Mahfuz was present in the gallery during the match against Afghanistan; he will also be present for the England game. However, he is more intrigued by the drama of cricket than the result. His eyes search for characters on the cricket field. The majority of the Bangladeshi fans in Dharamshala are students, who came from different regions in India. Punjab University's student Raihan feels that more people from Bangladesh would've come had the process to obtain the visa been less complicated. ""Actually, many people I know were supposed to come, but they couldn't due to the delays in the visa application process. Hopefully, more people will be present for the next matches."" The supporters are going through many adversities on their journey to India with great hopes in their hearts. Almost all the fans are hoping that Bangladesh will qualify for the semifinals.

"'Bangladesh will be a dangerous side in the World Cup' | The Daily Star","Skipper Shakib Al Hasan on Friday said Bangladesh will be a ""dangerous side"" in the World Cup after they edged India by six runs for a consolation Asia Cup victory. India, who had already booked a meeting with Sri Lanka in Sunday's final in Colombo, faltered in their chase of 266 despite a valiant 121 by opener Shubman Gill. Mustafizur Rahman took three wickets while debutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Mahedi Hasan claimed two each as Bangladesh bowled out India for 259 to end their tournament on a high ahead of the upcoming ODI World Cup. ""I think we have got a very good team (for the World Cup),"" man of the match Shakib, who scored 80 in Bangladesh's 265-8, said after the win. ""Lot of injuries, and players coming in and going out didn't help during this Asia Cup. I think we will be a dangerous side in the World Cup."" India rested their key players including Virat Kohli and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the inconsequential clash. ""We wanted to give some game time to the guys, keeping the bigger picture in mind. Not compromising on how we wanted to play this game,"" India skipper Rohit Sharma said after his first loss in the tournament. ""Get in some players who are likely to play the World Cup. Axar batted brilliantly, but couldn't finish. He showed a lot of character. Not to forget, Gill's hundred was brilliant."" Tanzim's 'dream wicket' Rohit elected to bowl first to test their batting under lights, which has been difficult in the Sri Lanka leg of the tournament hosted by Pakistan. Bangladesh slipped to 59-4 before a 101-run stand between Shakib and Towhid Hridoy, who made 54, rebuild the innings and with lower-order contribution posted a total which ultimately proved winning. Hridoy and Shakib hit back with regular boundaries before pace bowler Shardul Thakur returned for a second spell and bowled Shakib. Ravindra Jadeja collected his 200th ODI wicket but Hridoy kept up the charge and reached his fifty with a boundary before falling to Shami. Nasum Ahmed, a left-arm spinner who is known to slog with the bat, also contributed with 44 while Mahedi added 29. Thakur took three wickets while Shami returned figures of 2-32. In reply, India lost Rohit in the first over as he got caught out off Tanzim, a 20-year-old fast bowler, who called the scalp a ""dream wicket"". Gill stood firm and put on key partnerships with KL Rahul (19) and then Suryakumar Yadav (26) but Bangladesh bowlers kept chipping away with wickets. Gill, who hit eight fours and five sixes in his 133-ball knock, reached his hundred off Tanzim and bowed to the dressing room. He kept up the charge as he hit Mahedi for a huge six over mid-wicket but the bowler had his revenge on the next ball to get the batsman caught out. Axar Patel attempted to pull off the chase in his 34-ball 42 but fell to Mustafizur and the innings soon ended in 49.5 overs. Bangladesh ended the tournament with two wins including one in the group stage against Afghanistan. Babar Azam's Pakistan crashed out of the tournament after losing a knockout Super Four contest to Sri Lanka at the same venue. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"‘I believed that I would bowl the perfect yorker’ | India vs Bangladesh Asia Cup Super 4 | The Daily Star","Despite not being in the running for the final, Bangladesh ended their Asia Cup on a high by beating India in a tight Super Four game in Colombo's R Premadasa Stadium on Friday. After Shakib Al Hasan's 80 rebuilt the innings, the Tigers needed to overcome a compact Shubman Gill ton as some pride was restored. Youngster Tanzim Hasan Sakib, making his debut, got the new ball talking in a way which should keep selectors on their toes while his cool effort in the final over ensured a six-run win – Tigers' second in the Asia Cup history against India. Earlier, skipper Shakib and Tawhid Hridoy's 101-run fifth-wicket stand, turned things around after early collapse. Nasum Ahmed and Sheikh Mahedi made important contributions with the bat in the lower middle-order as the score climbed to 265. On his debut, the 20-year-old Sakib, removed Rohit Sharma in just the second delivery of the innings. Even the confident and in-form Gill had to persevere during Sakib's spell. In his next over, Sakib took the top of Tilak Varma's off-stump with one that moved in after pitching, with the batter leaving the delivery alone only to find himself castled. The youngster bowled six overs on the trot with the new ball, giving away just 15 runs. ""Rohit bhai was my dream wicket, my debut wicket. I just concentrated on line and length and maintained it and that's how I got the early success. I am always prepared for bowling longer spells when my team needs me. I am always ready to bowl,"" he said at the post-match ceremony. Despite being taken for 12 runs in the 39th over by Gill, Sakib was entrusted to bowl the last over with India requiring 12. He mixed his deliveries and then bowled a yorker in the penultimate delivery where a run-out secured the win. ""That ball, I was once again thinking of the bowlers but it was very tight with two balls and eight runs. So I went for the yorker. I believed that I would bowl the perfect yorker and that's what happened,"" Sakib added on his death over bowling performance. It was not just Sakib but also Mustafizur Rahman's death bowling that came to the Tigers' rescue. The left-arm paceman saw the back of dangerous Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, bagging three for 50 in eight overs. Yet, with just two pacers in the armoury, the Tigers' spin attack had to do the bulk of the bowling. Shakib himself was economical and effective, also bagging Suryakumar Yadav's scalp while Mahedi and Mehedi Hasan Miraz took crucial wickets. ""After the last couple of games here, we thought spinners will do well,"" Shakib said after the match. Mahedi had given the important breakthrough earlier with KL Rahul's wicket before his death over efforts kept things tight while also removing Gill after a 133-ball 122 that really put the pressure on India. With the World Cup to come, the win should serve as a morale-boosting one. ""A lot of players are injured and some going in and out, that didn't help us. I think we will be a dangerous side in the World Cup,"" Shakib said. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Injury forces Theekshana out of Asia Cup final | The Daily Star","Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana has been ruled out of the Asia Cup final against India due to an injury, captain Dasun Shanaka confirmed Saturday. Theekshana, 23, hurt his hamstring during their Super Four win over Pakistan to make the Sunday final of the 50-over tournament, a prelude to the next month's ODI World Cup in India. ""He won't be able to take part in this game since he got a Grade 3 injury, but he will be there for the World Cup,"" Shanaka told reporters on the eve of the title clash in Colombo. Theekshana claimed eight wickets in five matches to lend support to a youthful bowling attack alongside pacer Matheesha Pathirana and fellow spinner Dunith Wellalage. Top order batsman Sahan Arachchige will join the squad while Theekshana undergoes rehabilitation, Sri Lanka Cricket said. Sri Lanka, who cohosted the tournament with Pakistan, came in as underdogs but have made their 11th Asia Cup final and a have chance to clinch their seventh title. The island nation snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan and have kept up their momentum despite losing to India in the Super Fours. ""The boys really want to deliver for the country,"" said Shanaka. ""As a team we have been underdogs, so everyone wants to perform on the bigger stage.

"‘We love cricket but cannot pay so much to watch’ | The Daily Star","Sri Lanka Cricket slashed ticket prices for the Asia Cup by up to 95 percent on Sunday after costs were hiked 40-fold and matches were played in near-empty stadiums. Tickets for one-day internationals in crisis-hit Sri Lanka have generally cost around 250 rupees ($0.78) previously. That was hiked to 10,000 rupees for the Asia Cup, which is being organised by the Pakistan Cricket Board despite largely taking place in Sri Lanka, and fans in the cricket-mad island country have stayed away in droves. Barely 7,000 home supporters turned out for Sri Lanka's Super Four clash against Bangladesh on Saturday at the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, leaving the hosts facing the embarrassing sight of ranks of empty seats. In an attempt to lure them, back Sri Lanka Cricket announced a price cut of up to 95 percent Sunday for all remaining Super Four games, including marquee clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan, with tickets now costing as little as 500 rupees. The stratospheric price hikes had infuriated fans. Sri Lanka endured months of food, fuel and medicine shortages last year after a foreign exchange crunch, which sparked widespread protests culminating in the ouster of its president. The 50-over Asia Cup is a precursor to the upcoming ODI World Cup, and most of the matches were moved to Sri Lanka after India refused to tour Pakistan due to political tensions. ""Pakistan have kept the ticket pricing too high and that has kept fans away from the stadiums,"" a local Sri Lankan official told AFP on condition of anonymity. ""Ticket costs... are way beyond the reach of a common man,"" he added. ""This is bizarre. We tried to reason with the PCB but they had their reasons as they have lost out on money, maybe."" The PCB did not immediately respond to requests for comment by AFP. There were still hardly any spectators Sunday for the India-Pakistan game, for which grandstand tickets were priced at a whopping 64,000 rupees ($200). And fans were not amused. ""This is not good. We love cricket but cannot pay so much to watch a match,"" Supun Vijayarathnam, a tea seller outside the Colombo stadium, told AFP. ""I have watched many matches here for just 100 and 200 rupees. But this time I have to watch it on TV and just hear the noise, which of course is less."" Fans travelled from both India and Pakistan for the hotly anticipated clash after their first meeting was washed out in Pallekele. ""We paid 16,000 Sri Lankan rupees for this game. We were there in Kandy as well and had to pay 15,000 there,"" Arun Kumar Yadav, from the northern Indian city of Lucknow, told AFP. ""The prices are too high from the last time that we came here,"" added the 35-year-old. ""But it's the love of cricket."" A street vendor selling India and Pakistan jerseys and flags said that despite the game being a blockbuster, there were ""fewer fans and the buzz is less"". দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Key players out injured as Sri Lanka name Asia Cup squad| The Daily Star","Sri Lanka have been hit by injuries to key bowlers as they named their 15-member squad for Asia Cup 2023.

"Shaheen Afridi warns 'best yet to come' | The Daily Star","Pakistan pace ace Shaheen Shah Afridi has warned his devastating spell against arch-rivals India that set the Asia Cup alight is just the start, with the World Cup only weeks away. The left-arm fast bowler rattled the Indian top-order in their Group A clash last week, taking 4-35 -- including the wickets of star batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. That match was washed out but they meet again in Colombo on Sunday in the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup, a precursor to the 50-over World Cup that kicks off next month. And Shaheen told AFP there is more to come. ""Every match against India is special and people watch this a lot,"" the 23-year-old said Friday. ""I used to wait for this match as a fan before I played under-16 cricket."" ""I can't say this has been my best spell so far. This is just the start and there will be many more, so the best is yet to come."" With his ability to move the ball both ways, Shaheen leads one of the most potent pace attacks in the world. ""If you play all the three formats at such a young age for Pakistan and handle the new ball, people expect you to perform like that,"" he said. Shaheen and his fellow fast bowlers Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf have picked up 23 wickets between them in the Asia Cup so far. ""We know our roles with the new and old ball,"" Shaheen said. ""Haris is quicker than us and impacts with his pace. Naseem and I try to get early breakthroughs."" The ""communication is good between us,"" he added. ""And that's our success."" Afridi advice Shaheen, who stands at 6 feet and 6 inches (1.98 metres), suffered a serious knee injury last year but returned strongly in Sri Lanka in July. ""It's your match time that helps you improve. These Test matches against Sri Lanka recently made me improve as I bowled long spells and fielded all day,"" said Shaheen, who has 105 wickets in 27 Tests. ""So that cleared all doubts about the knee injury."" Shaheen has never played cricket in India -- bilateral cricket ties are frozen because of political tensions between the neighbours. He is keen to do well when Pakistan take on hosts India in the hotly anticipated World Cup match in Ahmedabad on October 14. ""All the foreign players who have played in the IPL (Indian Premier League), we had discussions with them. I think our Pakistan wickets or Dubai pitches will be similar,"" he said. ""Spinners will get more help, maybe. We will hit good lengths. Our team performance is going well as the number one (ODI) team. We have prepared well."" Shaheen is married to one of the daughters of former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, and said he speaks to the former all-rounder before every big match. ""I try to pick his brains before a big game and include it in my plans as he was a big-match player,"" said Shaheen. ""He talks simply and says: 'Just play your cricket'."" A fan of legendary Pakistani left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram, Shaheen said he keeps his focus on the field by avoiding cricket off it. ""I don't go out much and stay in my room. Just stay indoors, make green tea... and talk about anything other than cricket,"" he said.

"Yusuf blitz sees Mushfiqur’s Joburg Buffaloes into Zim Afro T10 final | The Daily Star","Yusuf Pathan of India smashed a breathtaking 26-ball 80 to fire Joburg Buffaloes, also featuring Bangladesh's Mushfiqur Rahim, into the final of the Zim Afro T10 league after registering a six-wicket win over Durban Qalandars in Qualifier 1 on Friday. Chasing a 141-run target, Joburg Buffaloes got over the line with one ball to spare at the Harare Sports Club. Chasing a steep target, Joburg Buffaloes found themselves in a precarious position, losing four for 57 in 5.1 overs. However, from there on, Mushfiqur and Yusuf stitched together a rapid 85-run fifth-wicket stand off just 28 deliveries to steer their side home.  Yusuf scored the bulk of the runs, remaining unbeaten after a spectacular knock that saw five boundaries and eight maximums. Mushfiqur played the role of second fiddle, scoring a 10-ball 14 not out, featuring two boundaries. Earlier, Durban Qalandars posted a commendable 140 for four in the 10-over-game, thanks to scores of 39, 32*, 24*, and 20 from Andre Fletcher, Asif Ali, Nick Welch, and Miraz Baig, respectively. Mushfiqur's Joburg Buffaloes will play the same opponent in the final today after the Qalandars beat Harare Hurricanes by four wickets in the Qualifier 2 later yesterday to progress to the final. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Tigers renew focus with white-ball camp today | The Daily Star","The lone Test against Afghanistan ended in emphatic fashion for the hosts on Saturday but a few Bangladesh players have already begun training individually at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium indoor nets yesterday. While veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim was seen sweating it out and seemingly in search of adding a few new shots to his repertoire, the likes of pacer Hasan Mahmud also underwent a session with the bat at the indoor nets on the eve of official white-ball practice, starting from today. Hasan's bowling partner, Taskin Ahmed, suggested earlier that the upcoming ODI series against Afghanistan -- scheduled to begin from July 5 -- will ""be challenging"". ""Everyone had been preparing well [with white ball] even before the Test began. We are hopeful of something good, although it won't be easy [in the ODIs against Afghanistan],"" Taskin said following a commercial event on Monday. Taskin relayed the emphatic 546-run Test win ""is in the past now"" and that the ""next game will begin from the first ball"". The Tigers' pace spearhead believes their work will now begin anew to maintain growth of improvement, with two major tournaments in sight. ""The pacers are doing well but everything will start with focus on that match [on July 05]. ""Normally, Chattogram offers sporting, batting-friendly wickets. However, we are all hopeful that if we can maintain our consistency in terms of improvement, everyone will be gradually prepared for the upcoming World Cup and Asia Cup,"" Taskin concluded. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

"Shakib likens Tamim's behaviour to a child's antics | The Daily Star","Bangladesh ODI captain Shakib Al Hasan gave his opinion regarding Tamim Iqbal's exclusion from the World Cup squad in an exclusive interview with T Sports, aired on Wednesday night. In a roundabout way, Shakib detailed that the decision to exclude Tamim was part of many processes and facts which he was not part of. He used Mahmudullah Riyad as an example. ""Mahmudullah Riyad bhai wasn't there but suddenly he came to the World Cup team. I felt he couldn't do that but his dedication, his responsibility for the team and his urge to play for the team, those things were noticed by all. So there is a difference,"" Shakib said, indicating that there was a difference in attitude between Mahmudullah and Tamim. Tamim had said in a Facebook video yesterday, posted after the Bangladesh team's departure for India, that a board high-up had approached him to skip the first World Cup game and also bat lower down the order. Shakib denied involvement in such a request being put to Tamim. He, however, likened Tamim's behaviour to a child's antics at the playground. ""I have not discussed anything like that so I don't know where the question is coming from….If someone made that proposal, is there something wrong with it? Or is it like you can't make a proposal like that? Like you have to tell a particular person that 'you do whatever you want?' It's like a childish behaviour where someone is saying 'it's my bat, only I will play.' ""For the good of the team, anyone should be ready to play in any position. It's about team first,"" he added. ""Someone like Rohit Sharma built his career from No. 7 to opener, scored 10,000-plus runs. If he sometimes bats at No 3 or 4, would it be a big problem? It is totally childish. It is my bat, I will play. No one else can play. A player should bat at any position for the team. Team first. It doesn't make any difference if you have made 100 or 200, and the team loses. What can you do with personal achievement? You want to make a name for yourself? ""You are not thinking about the team at all. People don't understand these things. Why was the proposal given to him? It was for the team. What is wrong in that? You are a team man when you agree to such a proposal. Unless you are thinking along those lines, you are not a team man. You are playing for individual records, success, fame, and name. Not for the team."" Shakib also said why taking Tamim would have been a difficult proposition for him. ""Kane Williamson won't play the first two matches, but then he will start playing,"" Shakib said. ""If I knew something like this, I wouldn't have any problems. But if I know that there's uncertainty about him playing the seventh or the third or the first game, or that I will only know in the morning of the game, it will be difficult for me to select the team. I don't think we need such a player."" ""I didn't discuss the subject with the particular player, medical team or selector. It is definitely the board's decision. People might doubt my capability or capacity but someone like MS Dhoni, who has won everything and has the knowledge and sense, once said that the unfit player who is playing is cheating his team and country. I think we should accept it, and not just Tamim but every player."" Shakib also asserted that he was willing to resign from captaincy after the Asia Cup (September 17) but didn't do so on request of BCB high-ups. ""I never gave any conditions for captaincy. On the 17th [September], I sent a mail to resign from the captaincy. I will not captain for a day after the World Cup. That's why I didn't want to take it before the Asia Cup. I felt like I wanted to laugh, play, perform. That's one reason I didn't want to take it."" informed Shakib. ""I have not given any conditions. Given the circumstances, the easiest was not to take. Papon Bhai [BCB president Nazmul Hassan] also told me in the beginning that there is no need to do it. I have no reason to take this pressure at this age. I want to smile, perform for Bangladesh. And want to spend the last few days well. He described the situation in his own way, ""A captain's job is not only just in on-field but running outside the field too. The board, coach, team management felt that it is not possible without me. I did not believe that anyone could give up in such an important situation. There is no reason to take it here,"" ""There is no other reason. It is best if there is no captain. Is captaincy adding any value to my career at this stage? I don't think so,"" the Bangladesh captain said. Shakib also criticised Tamim for resigning as ODI captain just two months out from the World Cup. ""I have often heard in the dressing room that he is leaving the captaincy. Even a player once told him that 'bhai, leave it early so that the new captain gets a bit of time'. Exactly that's what happened. The one who came in, didn't get the time. Each and everyone knew including the selectors and board officials. Papon bhai (BCB president Nazmul Hassan) certainly knew about it. ""I don't know why he didn't leave it (earlier). He can tell you. It is like, your commander takes you to war but (Shakib mimicking a solider) after he has got you ready, the commander isn't telling you to fire or retreat. Where will you go? We were in this situation in the last two matches against Afghanistan (in July). ""The captain wouldn't have changed ahead of the Asia Cup and the World Cup, unless he himself announced that he was resigning or retiring. It would have happened 18 months ago, when everyone knew what was about to happen."" During the half-hour interview, the ace all-rounder also touched upon his individual plans for future, saying he might hang up his bat soon, with next year's T20 World Cup his last in that format and the 2025 Champions Trophy might be his last outing in ODIs. He said he might give up playing Tests even sooner, even though these are not chalked out yet. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"De Kock shines as South Africa make 311-7 against Australia | The Daily Star","Quinton de Kock hit his second successive century at the World Cup on Thursday as South Africa made 311-7 in their group game against five-time champions Australia. The 30-year-old De Kock reached his 19th ODI hundred off 90 balls with eight fours and five sixes having also made a century in South Africa's opening win over Sri Lanka. De Kock, who will retire from international cricket at the end of the tournament, was batting in familiar surroundings at the Ekana Stadium where he plays in the IPL for the Lucknow Super Giants. He was eventually dismissed for 109, bowled by off-spinner Glenn Maxwell while trying to reverse sweep in the 35th over. South Africa were on 197-3 at the time before Aiden Markram then took up the charge. Having made the fastest World Cup century off just 49 balls in the win over Sri Lanka, Markram raced to 56, making the most of being dropped by Australia skipper Pat Cummins when he had made just a single. It was a miserable day in the field for Australia as South Africa captain Temba Bavuma was also dropped twice on 19 and 32. Mitchell Marsh dropped Virat Kohli in their opening game when the Indian star was on 12. Kohli went on to make a match-winning 85. Bavuma's luck ran out on 35 when he was caught at midwicket by David Warner off Maxwell. With De Kock, the skipper put on 108 for the first wicket. Once Markram was dismissed by Cummins, the Proteas saw Marco Jansen (26) and David Miller (17) take them past the 300 mark.

"Tigers impress in rain-affected SA Test series | The Daily Star","With only three days of play possible in the first Test against South Africa at Chittagong, and just a single day in the second match at Mirpur, cyclone 'Komen' and the seasonal downpour dominated the headlines for obvious reasons. Yet it was not all doom and gloom for Bangladesh, especially the spirited performance from their bowlers sent the right signals in an otherwise disappointing Test series against the top-ranked team in the world. In the first Test at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury stadium, Bangladesh bowled out a higher-ranked opponent under 300 for the first time in nearly three years. Tigers skipper Mushfiqur Rahim was pleasantly surprised by the discipline shown by his opening bowler Mohammad Shahid, and appreciated Mustafizur Rahman's ability to adapt to the longest format of cricket quite quickly. Shahid delivered 50 dot balls in a row from his sixth to his 14th over on the first day, a spell that tightened the screws on the Proteas. Unfortunately for the pacer, he went wicketless as two relatively straight-forward catches were dropped in the slips off his bowling. Shahid gave away only 34 runs in 17 overs, with nine maidens to show for his lion-hearted effort on a docile pitch at Chittagong. Captain Mushfiqur felt his hard work deserved better reward. ""I was definitely surprised [by the seven maidens]. I haven't seen many bowlers in the world bowl like that on such a flat wicket."" Mushfiq told ESPNcricinfo. Bangladesh's bowling attack looked more potent with the inclusion of the in-form left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman. He took three wickets in four balls - Hashim Amla, JP Duminy and Quinton de Kock and turned the match on its head in a matter of minutes. Mustafizur was named the Man of the Match in the 1st Test and became the first cricketer in history to win that award on both Test and ODI debut. In his debut Test, Mustafizur grabbed four wickets for 37 runs in 17.4 exciting overs. Bangladesh's batting in the first innings of the 1st Test would have also soothed some nerves in the dressing room, mainly because of the timely maturity shown by Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan. Both of them worked through difficult circumstances on the second and third day, offering the full face of the bat for most deliveries. Tamim managed 57 while Shakib missed his first fifty against South Africa by three runs. With Mahmudullah's knock of 67 and Litton Das debut fifty, Bangladesh's scorecard looked impressive, but all the set batsmen missed the chance to score a hundred. In the 2nd Test at Mirpur, Bangladesh won the toss and batted first. After early jitters, the middle-order steadied the innings, but Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque and Mahmudullah were all dismissed against the run of play. Mushfiqur Rahim became the first Bangladesh captain to score a fifty against South Africa with his knock of 65, but his team lost four wickets for 31 runs in the last hour to end the first day at 246/8 in 88.1 overs. The recurring problem of batsmen throwing their wickets away after getting their eyes in will not please Tigers head coach Chandika Hathurusinghe. Even Shakib Al Hasan expressed his frustration over the batsmen's failure to convert their good start into a big knocks. ""Well if you see our scorecard, there are five six guys who got starts. Someone needed to score big runs and that didn't happen and that is the frustrating part."" ""On the other side, everyone is contributing that's a good sign, but we would love to see more people get hundreds, and whenever they get a hundred we need to make sure of getting a big one,"" he said while talking to GTV, the broadcaster of the series. Bangladesh fans hope Tamim and co will not repeat the same mistakes against Australia, scheduled to play two Tests, from October 9 to 13 in Chittagong and October 17 to 21 in Dhaka. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"2nd Test called off | The Daily Star","After three consecutive washed-out days, match officials decided to call off the 2nd Test between Bangladesh and South Africa as the outfield was rendered unfit for play at Mirpur stadium. Heavy rain, some monsoonal, some caused by cyclone Komen, washed out days two, three and four and the aftermath made play impossible on day five. Despite the porous draining system, the outfield had taken too much rain. The umpires gauged it would take between four and five hours to dry before any action could begin, and it being the final day, decided that was impractical. With both the Test matches rained out, the series is drawn 0-0. South Africa, who are currently at the top of the Test rankings on 130 points, will lose five points, while Bangladesh, who sit at No.9, will gain six points. After an engrossing day of cricket on the first day, Bangladesh were at 246 for 8 in 88.1 overs with Nasir Hossain unbeaten on 13 at the wicket. Several Bangladeshi batsmen got out after good starts, while Mushfiqur Rahim became the first skipper for his side to score a fifty against South Africa in Test matches. Dale Steyn became the 13th bowler to take 400 Test wickets but South Africa's part-time spinners enjoyed most of the success with JP Duminy taking three good wickets on the opening day of this Test. Bangladesh will now enjoy some time off while South Africa return home for a limited-overs series against New Zealand before a high-profile tour of India and a home series against England.

"Search for relief ends in disappointment | The Daily Star","The stands at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai were mostly empty for today's Bangladesh-New Zealand World Cup match with some clusters of fans sprinkled across the massive gallery. In one such cluster, around 30 or so Bangladeshis were looking on in despair as Shakib Al Hasan's troops kept losing wickets at regular intervals against the Kiwis. The disappointment of seeing the Tigers hobble to a sub-par total was not a pleasant sight for any Bangladesh fan present at the venue. However, for this selection of fans, the sorry display of the batters was even more disheartening. ""When we heard the Bangladesh team will come here to play their World Cup match against New Zealand, more than 30 of us who are here from Bangladesh for medical purposes decided to watch the game together,"" said Ruhul Amin, who came to Chennai from Brahmanbaria with his wife around two weeks ago for medical purposes. Unlike most Bangladeshis at the venue, the main purpose of their visit to Chennai was not to see the Tigers in action. They have made the journey to the capital of Tamil Nadu state to receive medical treatment. Exhausted from the constant visits to hospitals, pharmacies, and medical testing facilities and staying away from their loved ones for weeks or even months, many Bangladeshi patients came to the Chepauk Stadium on Friday to see the Tigers in action, in hopes of forgetting their hardships for a few hours at least. ""To be honest, it's not easy to come to another country for treatment purposes as it can take a huge mental toll. Apart from going to the hospital and returning to the hotel, we have hardly done anything else since arriving in Chennai,"" Ruhul added, reflecting how Shakib's team treated them with further disappointment in the first innings of the match, as they could only muster 245-9 in their 50 overs. Every year around 2.5 million Bangladeshis travel to India for medical purposes. Chennai is a popular destination among them for its top-notch medical facilities at comparatively affordable rates. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Bangladesh beat Pakistan to win bronze in men's cricket | The Daily Star","Bangladesh clinched the bronze medal in men's cricket event of the Asian Games today with a thrilling six-wicket victory in DLS method over Pakistan in Hangzhou today. The men in red and green clinched the third position as Rakibul Hasan struck the last ball for a boundary to get the score to 65 in five overs. Yasir Ali, who fell on the penultimate delivery, did the most damage by scoring a 16-ball 38 in the rain-curtailed affair. Afif Hossain scored 20 off 11 deliveries. Bangladesh were set a revised target of 65 in five overs after rain abruptly ended Pakistan's innings for 48 for one after five overs. Earlier, Mirza Baig smashed 32 not out off 18 deliveries as Pakistan reached 48 for one in five overs before rain stopped play. Bangladesh had won the toss and put the opposition into bat following a delayed start due to rain. This is Bangladesh's only second medal of the event, with the first coming in women's cricket.

"Mahmudullah fourth Bangladeshi to 5,000 ODI runs | The Daily Star","Mahmudullah Riyad became the fourth Bangladesh batter to reach the 5,000 ODI runs landmark as Bangladesh were building around a half-century from Najmul Hossain Shanto in the third and final match against New Zealand in Mirpur on Tuesday. Mahmudullah, the right-handed batter, reached the milestone in the 16th over by taking a single off Lockie Ferguson. Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim are the three other batters to have reached the milestone before Mahmudullah for Bangladesh. Mahmudullah was batting on 10 with Shanto, the stand-in skipper on 51, as Bangladesh reached 112 for 4 after 21 overs. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Mahmudullah sweats it out ahead of Asia Cup camp | The Daily Star","Hours before coming to the BCB Academy Ground in Mirpur yesterday to partake in an individual practice session, Mahmudullah Riyad had posted a story on his social media accounts. It was his first session since returning from Hajj, a session which garnered the attention of the media as well. The batter had been curiously left out of the squad drawn ahead of the Afghanistan series and later it was known that he had applied for vacation and would join the camp after the Hajj. Before that, he had been dropped from the series against Ireland at Chelmsford as the team management wanted to look at some younger stars. 'Challenge your story,' Mahmudullah's social media post read, perhaps a hint that he was aiming for a fightback. The question being pondered by fans and media alike was whether Mahmudullah wanted to get back into the side for the Asia Cup and the World Cup. Having retired from Tests and having been dropped from the T20I line-up as the management was in favour of preparing the T20I unit with younger players for the future, ODIs remain the veteran's most viable option. Mahmudullah sweated it out at the training session, undertaking a 25-minute running drill followed by a gym session for 15 minutes. He then batted at the academy nets for at least 20 minutes before going through the grind at the indoor nets for about half-an-hour. He, however, did not bowl. A crucial aspect of the current selection scenario is that the team management is looking for a bowling all-rounder at number seven position in the batting order. Whether Mahmudullah would be able to overcome his shoulder issue and contribute as a bowler is exactly what he would need to challenge in his story. A BCB official, on conditions of anonymity, told The Daily Star that all-rounder has not been written off. ""He [Mahmudullah] can of course return but it depends on the management and the selectors' plan. No one can claim he is out of contention,"" the official said. ""He is also a contracted player and one would have to understand the scenario before reaching a conclusion,"" the official added. Rumours are out there that Soumya Sarkar could yet land a place in the Asia Cup and World Cup squad if he can pull off performances. Having struggled immensely to perform with consistency, the left-handed batter struck a ton in the Dhaka Premier League in May this year. He was then included in the Emerging Asia Cup squad in Sri Lanka, where he has bagged five wickets as Bangladesh A confirmed the semifinal berth. Scores of 42 and 48 also see him now challenge for a spot since Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusingha already said at a press conference during the Afghanistan series that players that would perform in the Emerging Asia Cup 'definitely' had a chance and if someone scores runs, they are putting those names up for selection. Off-spinning all-rounder Shaikh Mahedi, too, has played a few handy knocks down the order while returning decent figures with the ball in Sri Lanka. Star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and ODI vice-captain Liton Das have set sail to play in the Global T20 League in Canada with Shakib's NOC being granted till July 29 and Liton's NOC granted till August 10. Shakib is expected to play the Lankan Premier League as well, which begins on July 30. Mushfiqur Rahim and Taskin Ahmed are expected to return home before the Asia Cup camp, and as the players gear up for a return following their franchise commitments, media eyes would be on Mahmudullah and Soumya, and maybe to some extent of Mahedi, and whether they get into contention for that camp. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Mahmudullah question looms ahead of squad announcement | The Daily Star","With Shakib Al Hasan named as the ODI captain yesterday, there was no obstruction left to announce the Bangladesh squad for the Asia Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) later conveyed in a press release that it would announce the team in a press conference at 9:30 am today at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium. Earlier, BCB president Nazmul Hassan had informed the same while announcing the ODI skipper. ""I haven't talked to selectors but from what I know they are supposed to give the squad tomorrow. They were facing an issue since announcing the squad without knowing who the captain will be, and without talking to the captain, would have been a problem,"" Hassan told reporters at his residence yesterday. While the Asia Cup squad was also likely to be the World Cup squad, BCB may have to detach itself from that ploy due to Tamim Iqbal's injury as they try out openers alongside Liton Das. BCB president also relayed that the Asia Cup squad is almost close to being sorted. He identified that four or five pacers would be picked along with three spinners. Hassan also did not see much options in terms of tinkering with the available names that were called to the Asia Cup camp. ""We will take four pacers from the five we have or it could be that five pacers are included. We have to name a 17-member squad. Miraz is there [alongside Shakib] and we must take an extra spinner. Taijul and Nasum are available and since it's limited-over format, Nasum has a better chance,"" Hassan said. Bar the usual names, the opening slot replacements for Tamim and the inclusion of Mahmudullah Riyad were the biggest questions hanging in balance following Shakib's captaincy announcement. Riyad's inclusion in the 2019 World Cup was previously questioned after a reported dressing room bust-up with Shakib. With Shakib now in charge, whether Riyad's chances of inclusion diminish is what is being debated in the country's cricket fraternity. The board was supposed to name a 22-member squad initially but BCB president suggested a few players outside the 17-member squad he thought was probable. A member of the selection panel said they ""would name as many players as is asked"". ""Afif [Hossain], Mahmudullah and Shamim [Hossain] are there [outside of the 17-member squad]. My 17-member [squad] is done. Maybe we may have to include them and Mosaddek [Hossain] is also there,"" Hassan said. In terms of new faces, the selectors had seen promise in Tanzid Hasan Tamim. Meanwhile, Soumya Sarkar or Mohammad Naim may also be up for inclusion as opening slot options. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Shakib could have scored 10-12k runs had he played in better conditions | The Daily Star","Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusingha lauded the Tigers' ODI and Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan for reaching the milestone of 7000 ODI runs in ODIs, saying that had the premier all-rounder played in conditions like England, Australia, or even India, he would have scored around 12,000 runs in the 50-over format. ""Shakib, I know playing in Bangladesh most of the time, and earlier, playing against other teams who had better bowling attacks [than Bangladesh], which is not the case now, at least not for the last five to six years, but maybe when you were starting [in your career], it's not easy,"" Hathurusingha was heard as saying during an appreciation speech at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium dressing room in a video posted from the Bangladesh Cricket Board's [BCB] official Facebook page on Wednesday. Shakib reached yet another milestone in the ongoing full series at home against Ireland as he became only the second Bangladeshi after ODI skipper Tamim Iqbal to reach 7000 runs in the 50-over format during his 93-run knock in the first ODI against the Irish side last Saturday. He also became only the third player, after Sanath Jayasuriya (13430 runs, 323 wickets) and Shahid Afridi (8064 runs, 395 wickets), to score 7000 runs and take 300 wickets in ODI cricket. ""And the other thing is, to score a lot of runs here is not easy. If you had played somewhere in England, Australia, or India, it would have been 10,000 or 12,000 runs for your talent. This is a very big achievement, well done,"" Hathurusingha added as he handed a plaque to the champion cricketer.  Bangladesh team management also acknowledged the achievements of Tamim and Mushfiqur Rahim, who also reached different milestones in the Ireland series. Bangladesh ODI skipper Tamim became the first Bangladeshi and 40th overall to reach 15,000 international runs during his 23-run knock in the second ODI against Ireland last Monday. ""If you start flying, this team will be an even better team and will fly in the World Cup [upcoming ODI World Cup in India later this year]. So, congratulations on 15,000 [runs in international cricket],"" Bangladesh batting coach Jamie Siddons said addressing Tamim. Siddons also added that all the four stalwarts of Bangladesh -- Shakib, Tamim, Mushfiqur, and Riyad -- can still have the best three years of their careers. ""I know you are a great player, and when I first came back to Bangladesh this time, I wanted to make sure that you [Tamim], Mushy [Mushfiqur Rahim], Shakib, and even [Mahmudullah] Riyad have the best three years of your career. If you are gonna finish your career in three years or whenever it is, I still think you can have your best three years. So, let's make sure we get you back to that. Well done,"" Siddons said before giving Tamim his plaque. Mushfiqur, who also received a plaque from Hathurusingha, also reached the landmark of 7000 ODI runs, becoming the third Bangladeshi after Tamim and Shakib to do so during a blistering 60-ball century against Ireland in the second ODI. His 60-ball hundred is now the quickest in ODIs by a Bangladesh player, bettering the 63-ball ton Shakib had made against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2009.  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Bangladesh-Ireland Series 2023 | The Daily Star","Balbirnie found Liton’s glasses while batting in the first innings to be quite amusing. According to the Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, it is not necessary for him to bowl if he has five to six different options in his arsenal. Mushfiqur Rahim’s stellar outing with the bat against Ireland in the one-off Test in Mirpur, which ended with Bangladesh winning by seven wickets today, saw him cross the 14000-run mark in international cricket. Previously, board president Nazmul Hassan had stated a numerous times that the board were not going to allow players to feature in franchise leagues during international assignments. Bangladesh handed Ireland a seven-wicket defeat as the home side chased down a 138-run target before the end of the second session on the fourth day of the one-off Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur on Friday. Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan’s decision to not introduce himself into the bowling attack till the 66th over of the first innings against Ireland raised a lot of questions on the opening day of their lone Test in Mirpur. Shakib, eventually, bowled only three overs on that day. Ireland had appeared to be on the verge of defeat with top-order failing to counter Shakib Al Hasan and Taijul Islam in the final session on day two. From there, they found a way on day three to make Bangladesh toil on a hot and humid day. Few would have given Ireland to avoid an innings defeat, let alone stage a turnaround to keep the Mirpur Test alive as they began day three at 27 for four, but the visitors managed to claw their way back into the one-off Test against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium today. Ireland wicketkeeper-batter Lorcan Tucker joins a long list of cricketers who managed to score a century on Test debut as Ireland continue to stage an exceptional turnaround against Bangladesh in the third day of the one-off Test in Mirpur today. Following a productive first session on the third day, Ireland were on course to claw back their way into the match against Bangladesh in the one-off Test in Mirpur. However, the loss of set batter Harry Tector has given the visitors a big setback. Bangladesh remain in a strong position as their lead stretch past 100 on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh’s veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim brought up his 10th Test ton during the Tigers’ lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh Test and T20I skipper Shakib Al Hasan’s wait for his sixth Test ton continues as the star all-rounder fell just 13 short of the landmark score in their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Despite losing Mominul Haque early, Bangladesh dominated the morning session on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan and veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim started rebuilding after Mominul Haque departed early on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Candy Lappin, his mother was enjoying the cricket too, having seen the young players turn into international stars. Bangladesh spinners Taijul Islam and Mehedi Hasan Miraz combined to scalp three wickets in quick succession to leave Ireland struggling in the second session on the opening day of their one-off Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Oddly enough, Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan is yet to introduce himself even after over 40 overs bowled during the Tigers’ one-off Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today.

"‘I never played against someone who batted with sunglasses’ | The Daily Star","Liton Das was donning a sunglass in the first innings but did not wear one as he came out to open in the second innings. Mark Adair got the better of Liton in the second innings after a rapid start and the bowler gave a send-off to Liton, motioning to put on his sunglasses to watch where the ball had gone. Adair bowled a bouncer which hit Liton's helmet before the ball ricocheted off Liton's bat to crash on to the stumps. Liton was perplexed for a moment, wondering how the ball went behind and hit his stumps to castle him but Adair, who enjoyed the wicket, told Liton to put on the glasses again. Asked on Adair's send-off, Balbirnie found Liton's glasses while batting in the first innings to be quite amusing. ""I never played against someone who batted with sunglasses on. It looked pretty cool. I wouldn't be doing it myself. I'm not sure whether there was a prescription. He played nicely in the first innings but it was just a bit of fun. We were trying to create an uncomfortable atmosphere,"" Balbirnie said at the press conference today. Liton departed for a 19-ball 23 but his innings provided the momentum to avert pressure during the chase. Najmul Hossain Shanto was coming in next after Liton and Ireland skipper said that they wanted to create pressure on the batter coming in to the crease. ""With Shanto obviously we tried to create something cause he was gone first ball for a duck in the first innings and we tried to create a bit of pressure for him there cause we knew in order to win the game, we had to do something different. Yeah Mark enjoyed that one,"" Balbirnie said. Bangladesh went on to win with seven wickets in hand after unbeaten knocks of 51 and 20 from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mominul Haque respectively. Asked if they felt that they could have won, Ireland captain said all the pressure to win was on Bangladesh. ""100 per cent (felt we had a chance of winning this morning). The wicket was still pretty good, Ebadot bowled well, he attacked the stumps but we were confident we could get a 180 lead. Our message was all the pressure was on Bangladesh. If they had lost this game there would have been a lot more people in this press room. Even if they were 100 for none chasing 130 the pressure was on them, no-one expected Ireland to come here and win a Test match. We knew we needed early wickets but the way Liton played took the momentum away but we stuck at it, created chances, but it just wasn't to be,"" he added on Ireland's fight. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"It was the best we could expect, says Shakib | The Daily Star","Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan termed his side's performance in the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia as the Tigers' best-ever in the marquee event. The Bangladesh captain referred to their wins against the Netherlands and Zimbabwe as their previous best outcome in the main phase of this mega event was based on a win against West Indies in 2007. ""In terms of results, this is the best performance we had in T20 World Cups,"" said Shakib during a post-match presentation ceremony following a five-wicket defeat to Pakistan in their last Super 12 encounter. Bangladesh had a decent start against Pakistan after starting the day with good news as they got a new lease on life after the Netherlands sent South Africa crashing out of the tournament with a stunning 13-run victory in Adelaide in the first match of the day. The Tigers chose to bat first but threw away a solid foundation, only to depict their deficiency in T20 cricket, though a controversial dismissal of skipper Shakib made situation complicated for them. ""At the halfway stage we were 70 for 1. We wanted to get somewhere around 145-150 - would've been a reasonable total on that pitch. Knew it was going to be difficult for the new batters so wanted set batters to carry through to the end which didn't happen,"" Shakib addressed what he thought was the key reason behind the defeat. And while defending a low 128un target, pacer Taskin Ahmed once again came close to give his side a flying start but wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan Sohan dropped a sitter. Overall Bangladesh's fielding was hugely disappointing in defense of a small total. Bangladesh team and fans will have plenty to shout about regarding key umpiring decisions in matches that went against their favour against India and Pakistan. However, Shakib duly said that: ""We could've done better. But having said that, with the new guys coming in, with the changes, this is the best we could expect."" Bangladesh can cherish their best success but, in reality, the problem with the T20 cricket remains the same as before despite two wins and a close match against formidable India. If there was any standalone performance from anyone, it was Taskin who led the pack. Shakib, however, admitted that his performance was also not up to the mark. ""On my own performance - I could've done better. As long as I'm fit and performing, I'd love to play for my country. I'll try to play for Bangladesh for as many years as possible.""  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Bangladesh ready to put on a good show: Shakib | Daily Star","Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan said that his team will try to meet the lofty expectations of the fans back home in the forthcoming ICC ODI World Cup. Shakib made this statement during the Captains' Day event held in Ahmedabad on Wednesday, a day before the World Cup commences with the match between last year's finalists England and New Zealand at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Captains of all 10 participating teams were present during the event where they were asked questions about their team's expectations from the tournament. The Bangladesh captain did not set any specific goal but said his team wants to put forth a good show and live up to the expectations of the countrymen. ""Now it's time for us to put on a good show in this World Cup and I think our team is ready. Also the country is expecting a little more than what we did previously,"" said Shakib. Although Bangladesh are coming into the tournament after losing ODI series to Afghanistan and New Zealand at home and an underwhelming showing in the Asia Cup, Shakib reminded all about Bangladesh's third-place finish in the ICC ODI Super League and said his team are ready for the challenge. ""I think we have prepared well. If you talk about the last four years, since the 2019 World Cup, we are probably the third or fourth team in the qualifiers points system. We have done really well as a group,"" said the Bangladesh captain. In this World Cup, Shakib has the opportunity to elevate himself among the World Cup elites as he requires just 79 runs to enter the top five of the run-getters list and six wickets to enter the top 10 of the wicket-taker's list. Shakib, however, stated that he is not interested in personal achievements and is only concerned about contributing to team's success. ""I think it always inspires me to do better. Personally, I never looked at any stats as long as I'm contributing for my team. Team comes first, that's the motto of my career. That's how I want to go about it.""  দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Tenacious trendsetters primed to exhibit respective strengths | The Daily Star","After an engrossing tournament spanning 28 days, England will lock horns with Pakistan in the final of the ICC T20 World Cup at the MCG in Melbourne today, starting from 2pm Bangladesh Standard Time. England and Pakistan followed pretty much the same trajectory on their way to the final. Both teams had little chance of securing a semi-final berth at one point, yet they went on a rampage towards the business end of the Super 12, and made it to the knockouts by finishing second in their respective groups. That wasn't the end to their similarities, though, as both sides registered comprehensive victories in the semi-finals to book their place in the final. Although their paths leading to this finale have been pretty similar, it would be a mistake to think that they have followed and executed the same plans to chart their course. In fact, these are two teams with very different strengths and playing styles, and it's the contrast between them that will be exciting to watch in this highly anticipated final. It's going to be a battle between England's batting line-up and Pakistan's bowling attack. Jos Buttler's men bat with a fearless approach, and why shouldn't they? They have players capable of wielding the willow right down to number 11. Pakistan, on the other hand, depend on their dangerous bowling attack to dominate. They have bowlers capable of killing the game with the new ball, spinners capable of drying runs up in the middle overs and specialists capable of applying the choke in the death overs. In fact, their economy rate of 6.74 has been the best among all teams in this World Cup. But the two teams have also responded really well in areas that were considered as their weaker suits. England's bowling attack, which wasn't rated as highly as other teams, has stepped up really well to support their never-ending batting arsenal. Sam Curran has been a revelation with the ball, whereas Mark Wood has also proved that he is a world-class pacer. Adil Rashid hasn't dominated the wicket-taking columns but he has done just enough for England, operating at a mean economy rate of 6.25 in this tournament. Even their fifth and sixth bowling options have stepped up, with Ben Stokes claiming five wickets at 15.80 runs apiece and Liam Livingstone picking up three wickets while operating at 7.27 runs per over. Pakistan's batting line-up, which was thought to be too dependent on Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan, has also delivered in crunch situations, whenever their star batters have failed. All of Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan and Shan Masood have played crucial knocks at some point in the tournament, whenever their top-order hasn't been able to deliver. Even the 22-year-old Mohammad Haris has added a new dimension to Pakistan's batting line-up with his attacking approach. Overall, everything has worked out quite well for the two sides after a difficult start. But their fate in this contest will depend on what they do with their strengths once again. Is England going to bat Pakistan out of the contest, just like they did against India in the semi-final? Will Pakistan's bowling firepower turn out to be too hot to handle for England's batting unit? Whichever way this goes, it's going to be a riveting contest to watch. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Celebrities and athletes who are supporting Messi's Argentina | The Daily Star","Everyone is gearing up to watch the final of the 2022 Qatar World Cup between Argentina and France, and it seems that there are plenty of famous people who are choosing Lionel Messi over Kylian Mbappe. The current star of world football is coming up against his successor, and the pair play together at club level for Paris Saint-Germain. It seems that the legend status Messi holds can not yet be competed with, as so many celebrities and sports people are rooting for him to finally win the prize that has eluded him. Famous English singer Adele is going to be cheering on the Albiceleste. She was approached by a fan at a recent concert and then said: ""Are you from Argentina? Thank God they won on penalties today,"" in reference to the game against the Netherlands. Famous actress Julia Roberts is known to be a huge football fan and she was recently seen giving birthday wishes to former Manchester United player Jesse Lingard on Instagram. Roberts is also known to be a fan of Messi and Argentina. She was at El Clasico in 2017 and asked Messi for a picture after the game. Another Hollywood star is Christopher Mintz-Plasse who played McLovin in Superbad. His Twitter has been covered in material about the Argentina national team. Harry Styles also wrote 'Congratulations Argentina' ahead of a recent show, and Daddy Yankee has also been seen in social media videos supporting the Albiceleste. Another British star who is wishing Argentina well is tennis legend Andy Murray. At the end of the game between Argentina and Australia earlier in the tournament, Murray tweeted 'Messi is the man'. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"FIFA World Cup 2022 - Qatar World Cup Live Updates | The Daily Star","After hoisting his first World Cup trophy with Argentina in December, Lionel Messi said that tournament would be his last, but now it appears he's open to the possibility of playing in the 2026 event. Lionel Messi was a different kind of mood during the World Cup match against Netherlands and had a war of words with Dutch striker Wout Weghorst during his post-match interview following the match. Argentina’s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was greeted by a crowd estimated at 100,000 in his home town, Mar de Plata. The curtains closed on the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar on Sunday with the Lionel Messi-led Argentina clinching their third title by beating France in the final, but with barely very little time for the fans to let the euphoria sink in, the focus has promptly shifted back to club football. ""Muchachos, we can dream again..."" the hit song that accompanied Argentina on their conquest of the 2022 World Cup has found deep resonance in a country desperate for a feel-good moment. As the streets of the metropalitans and village Bangladesh are bustling with waving flags, chants, cheers for Lionel Messi and Argentina following their third World Cup victory in a breathtaking final against France on Sunday, Argentina Football Team’s official twitter handle thanked Bangladesh for their wonderful support they showered. Lionel Messi has gone one better again. Having broken the record for the most-liked post on Instagram, the World Cup-winning Argentine's celebratory post has proven so popular that it is now the most-liked social media post of all-time, across any social networking platform. Watching Sunday's World Cup final, Ahmed al-Salem was more emotional than most football fans when Qatar's emir placed a black and gold cloak over the shoulders of Argentina's victorious captain Lionel Messi. Several members of the France team that lost to Argentina in the World Cup final were subjected to ""hateful"" racist abuse on social media, the French Football Federation (FFF) said on Tuesday, adding it intended to file a legal complaint. Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi has been invited to ""eternalize"" his mark at Brazil's famous Maracana by leaving his footprints in the iconic stadium's Hall of Fame, the Rio de Janeiro State Sports Superintendence has said. Lionel Messi set yet another record on Tuesday after his Instagram post celebrating Argentina's World Cup win became the most-liked on the platform, breaking a nearly four-year-old record held by a photo of an egg. Lionel Messi’s World Cup fairytale lit up the year in football as heroics and heartbreak at the finals captivated fans and highlighted the growth of the world’s most popular sport despite the criticism of host country Qatar’s human rights record. France forward Kingsley Coman and midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni have been subjected to online racist abuse after missing their penalties in Sunday's World Cup final against Argentina, the BBC reported on Monday. Prior to the Qatar World Cup, Lionel Andres Messi had all but conquered everything for his country and the clubs he represented – prestigious titles, individual awards, accolades from teammates, opponents, and critics alike. Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema announced he was ending his international career on Monday, the day after France lost in the World Cup final to Argentina. Lionel Scaloni hardly ever shows emotion in the dugout. Whether his team scores a crucial goal or a spectacular one, he hardly moves a facial muscle, let alone unleash a joyous celebration like the ones you see from most coaches around the world. He sits there with a straight face, like a monk deep in meditation. "
"England-Bangladesh Series 2023 | The Daily Star","After helping Bangladesh complete a series sweep over world champions England in the shortest format, top-order batter Najmul Hossain Shanto earned big gains in the T20I batting rankings. England's 3-0 defeat in their Twenty20 series in Bangladesh was a real ""eye-opener"" for the world champions, white-ball coach Matthew Mott said. From being a constant subject of ridicule on social media to becoming the toast of the town, Najmul Hossain Shanto has seen it all. ""To finish the way we did today will leave a bit of a sour taste in our mouths but it also should act as an eye-opener for us on where we need to improve,"" Mott said. England’s World Cup-winning skipper Jos Buttler admitted that his side were ‘outplayed’ in the three-match T20I series, in which the visitors were whitewashed by hosts Bangladesh. Bangladesh T20I and Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan admitted that one particular over from Mustafizur Rahman ‘changed the game completely’ as he talked following the Tigers’ 16-run victory in the third T20I against England at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. The last time the current world champions suffered a series whitewash in this format were in 2014 when they lost 3-0 against Australia. Bangladesh, on the other hand, enjoyed a first three-match series sweep in this format for the first time since doing the same against Ireland in 2012. Mustafizur joined the 100-wicket club in his 81st match, eclipsing Shakib Al Hasan who reached the milestone in his 84th match. Malan had scored 53 off 47 deliveries. Opener Liton Das ended a lean patch with his career-best T20I score while Najmul Hossain Shanto continued his terrific form with yet another solid knock/ as Bangladesh amassed 158 for two wickets in the third and final T20I against England in Mirpur today. Opener Liton Das brought up his fifty as he and in-form batter Najmul Hossain Shanto kept the scoreboard moving at a decent pace after Bangladesh got off to a commanding start in the third and final T20I against England in Mirpur today. Thanks to openers Liton Das and Rony Talukdar, Bangladesh got off to a very commanding start in their third T20I against England in Mirpur today. England won the toss and elected to bowl against Bangladesh in the third T20I of the three-match series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan lauded the team's effort after Bangladesh registered a historic maiden T20I series win over the world champions England by beating the visitors by four wickets in the second of the three-match series at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur on Sunday. Bangladesh became the only team ever to have beaten a reigning world champion in their first assignment of that particular format since the World Cup as the Shakib Al Hasan-led side clinched the three-match T20I series, with a game in hand, against the ODI and T20 World Champions England on Sunday. With the Sher-e-Bangla surface offering a lot of grip and turn for the slower bowlers, Mehedi Hasan Miraz, in for Shamim Patwary for this match, turned the screws on England with his best figures of four for 12. After being put in to bat, England lost their top four batters, including skipper Jos Buttler, for 63 in 10 overs. Four different bowlers accounted for the four dismissals at the Mirpur pitch, which looks a bit difficult to play strokes. Phil Salt led a counter-attack from England after Taskin Ahmed struck an early blow, getting rid of Dawid Malan in his second over of the first spell. A team on a winning run, or one that had just broken a losing streak, usually keep their playing eleven and tactics unchanged, and for Bangladesh it is almost always the case. "
"Shanto rewarded with career-best T20I ranking after England series | The Daily Star","After helping Bangladesh complete a series sweep over world champions England in the shortest format, top-order batter Najmul Hossain Shanto earned big gains in the T20I batting rankings. In the Tigers' 3-0 T20I series triumph against England, Shanto remained the top run-getter with 144 runs to his name. His scores of 51, 46*, and 47* in the three matches, respectively, saw him shoot up 68 spots to 16th – his career-best T20I ranking. His rating point of 593 is also the highest ever gained by the batter in the format. Opener Liton Das, who redeemed himself after a string of poor performances with a match-winning 73 in the third and final T20I against England in Mirpur on Tuesday, also moved nine places up to 22, with a rating point of 566, in the batting rankings. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's left-arm seamer Mustafizur Rahman and skipper Shakib Al Hasan moved up in the T20I bowling rankings. Following a dismal ODI series, Mustafizur bounced back in the format he enjoys the most, scalping three wickets in the three-match T20I series against England. With an economy rate of 5.58, he remained the most economical of the players who played in all three of the matches in the series. The left-armer's most impressive performance was reserved for the final T20I, in which he played a pivotal role in turning the tie in the Tigers' favour with a crucial over in the middle. As a result of his efforts, he moved 16 places to 20th in the T20I bowling rankings. The ever-reliable Shakib, on the other hand, advanced nine spots to 24 on the same list. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Fizz ‘can’t wait' to join Delhi Capitals | The Daily Star","Mustafizur Rahman left the country on a rented private jet this morning to take part in the Indian Premier league (IPL), where he will represent Delhi Capitals. Fizz is not under a central red-ball contract, so he was allowed to leave ahead of the upcoming Test against Ireland, starting from April 4 in Mirpur. ""Heading to India for IPL 2023. Can't wait to join my Delhi Capitals family,"" Mustafizur expressed his emotion on his social media post. However, the 'cutter master' will miss the Delhi's first game today against Lucknow Super Giants. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon said that the board was maintaining its stance to not give No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan and vice-captain Liton Das to skip the Ireland Test for the IPL. On Friday, following Bangladesh's defeat against Ireland in the final T20I in Chattogram, Papon was asked to shed light on the truth regarding the rumours that both Shakib and Liton were given NOCs to play for Kolkata Knight Riders from the start of their campaign. ""This question again? When the IPL asked regarding the timeframe of players' availability, we informed them when they would be available. They included them based on that and that's how we will release the players,"" Papon said. ""We haven't informed anything [to media] but now, if you have given him the NOC [through rumours], you can do that but we don't know anything outside of that. We have been saying the same thing over and over again. We have even heard that NOCs have already been given. The only problem is: we don't know about it,"" the BCB boss added. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Form deficiencies bug Tigers ahead of Pakistan tie | The Daily Star","Bangladesh Skipper Shakib Al Hasan had already said during the ongoing World Cup that his side would approach the two games in Adelaide against Asian rivals India and Pakistan in relaxed mood, hoping to cause an upset or two. Yet, when things got tight against India, the batters jumbled up individual plans and the concept of playing as a unit went out of the window quickly. Consequently, wickets fell quickly. In a very important game, contributions are needed from more than just one player. Bangladesh have had their most successful outing in a T20 World Cup this campaign, winning two matches in the Super 12 stage. They have a chance to end on a high note in the final group fixture against Pakistan although qualification is a slim prospect. The team is in a rebuilding phase and performances can fluctuate, but before a crucial game it is also a chance to stake a claim for most of the batters in the middle and lower-middle order. But their form has continued to be an issue ahead of the high-stake game. Shakib's form has been below his own standards. Having come to the World Cup after averaging over 50 in the preceding tri-nation series in New Zealand, Shakib has scored just 44 runs in four innings at the World Cup. He has averaged 11 and his runs have come at a strike-rate of just over 97. While Liton Das and Shakib both carried form to the World Cup, the former has looked solid during his knocks while Shakib often looked awkward, like he was trying to force the issue. A number three berth remains on the cards for Shakib after he played there in the India game and Bangladesh will remain hopeful the skipper can find his touch. Having faced just 45 deliveries in the four games, Shakib will need to need to settle into a groove. Except games against the Netherlands and Zimbabwe, Afif Hossain too has struggled with just 71 runs in four games. His strike-rate of over 120 suggests that a little more application can go a long way to him making the kind of impact the team management expect of him. Yasir Ali managed just five runs in his three World Cup outings and as is usually the case, lower-order batters often see their batting order change for the greater good. His lack of runs have not come at a good time though. As the finishers, Mosaddek Hossain and Nurul Hasan have managed strike-rates under 120 in the tournament. With Pakistan bolstering a very attack-minded bowling line-up with equal intensity with the new ball and the old ball, Bangladesh's team management continue to ponder the form and need of an extra batter. Having picked Shoriful Islam, who went for 57 in four overs against India in the last game, they may now opt to go back to an extra batter due in batters' form deficiencies. The bowling has largely remained sharp over the course of this tournament but for the final match of the group, form can play a part in the team combination. দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"Pakistan seeking inspiration from '92 World Cup | The Daily Star","Pakistan have soaked up stories from the landmark 1992 Cricket World Cup final win over England in the lead up to Sunday's Twenty20 decider and hope to share their own tales of triumph in years to come, team mentor Matthew Hayden said on Friday. Imran Khan's side beat England by 22 runs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in that 50-overs tournament to claim their first World Cup trophy in a landmark moment for Pakistan cricket. Hayden said Pakistan board chief Ramiz Raja, who opened the batting and took the final catch that sealed victory in the 1992 final, had addressed Babar Azam's team on Friday morning. ""He was reliving some of those stories around the '92 World Cup,"" former Australia opener Hayden told reporters at the MCG. ""And I think that's great, because that's why you play the game. These boys .... their careers will be but a blink and they'll be looking back on this tournament. ""And they'll tell these stories around campfires in their villages, in media conferences like the one we are here and it will be an important chapter of Pakistan cricket - as the '92 campaign was."" For some, it might be difficult to fathom how the stars aligned for Babar and Khan in Australia three decades apart. For instance, both Babar and Khan lost their opening round games at the MCG; arch-rival India got the better of them in 1992 and 2022. Pakistan went on to win their last three games ahead of the semifinals on both occasions, but both Babar and Khan had to bank heavily on the results of other games to go through to the knockout stage on the last day of the group stage. New Zealand were the opponent in both semifinals, with the Kiwis batting first both times. There are also differences, of course. For a start, skipper Babar Azam is not 39 years old. England, who won the last 50-overs World Cup in 2019 on home soil, are rated clear favourites by bookmakers to win on Sunday after humiliating India by 10 wickets in Thursday's semi-final at Adelaide Oval. Hayden, however, felt Pakistan's attack would be a good match for the English and particularly their captain Jos Buttler and Alex Hales, who chased down 169 for victory in an unbroken partnership to embarrass India's bowlers. ""I think the bases are covered,"" said Hayden. ""I think both sides actually have got very equal set-ups. ""It's just 'even-stevens'. At the start of this tournament I always thought that England was going to be a huge threat. ""And here we are on the edge of a final."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "
"‘Everyone would love to see Pakistan-India final’ | The Daily Star","The prospect of a mouth-watering final between India and Pakistan at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup has everyone excited, according to Australia great Shane Watson. India and Pakistan successfully navigated different paths to the final four on a highly-fluctuating final day of Super 12 action on Sunday and now could be on track to meet in the T20 World Cup final if they each win their difficult semi-final match-ups. Rohit Sharma's side takes on England in Adelaide on Thursday in a battle between the top two teams on the T20I Team Rankings, while Pakistan will have to conquer in-form New Zealand at the SCG on Wednesday if they are to reach the title decider. Pakistan's chances of even reaching the semi-finals looked forlorn at the start of the day on Sunday, but the Netherlands' upset victory over South Africa provided Babar Azam's side the opportunity to clinch an unlikely semi-final berth. A hard-fought five-wicket victory over Bangladesh helped Pakistan clinch the last spot in the semis and Watson believes the chances of a rematch of their meeting at the MCG at the start of the tournament and a dream final between the two biggest rivals in cricket now looms as a strong possibility. ""Everyone would love to see Pakistan and India in the final,"" an excited Watson said at the SCG on Monday. ""I unfortunately missed that first (Super 12) game at the MCG, as I commentated the game previously between Australia and New Zealand. ""But from all reports, all the people that went along to that game said it was something very special and the game was obviously an amazing game to watch on TV as well. ""They played in the T20 World Cup final in 2007 and everyone would love to see it again."" Standing in Pakistan's way first and foremost is a battle against Kane Williamson's New Zealand and Watson is expecting the battle between the Kiwis' dynamic young opener Finn Allen and Pakistan's bevy of quality fast bowlers to have a major say in the outcome of the cut-throat clash. But Watson believes the fact Pakistan had all but given up on earning a spot in the semi-finals prior to Sunday's games may actually work in their favour as it will allow them to play with more freedom. ""There are certain times in all tournaments where a team just falls across the line and somehow finds its way into the finals and then goes on to win it,"" Watson noted. ""Especially when they weren't expecting to make the semis because of the way they played at certain times throughout this tournament. ""The freedom they are going to have after not expecting much in the middle of the tournament, so the freedom they are going to have is going to be very dangerous for the Kiwis."" দুই ডোজের এই টিকা শুধুমাত্র ৬ থেকে ১৬ বছর বয়সীদের জন্য অনুমোদন দিয়েছে বিশ্ব স্বাস্থ্য সংস্থা। "

"Rohit takes heart from wins in England | The Daily Star","Skipper Rohit Sharma says beating England in their back yard just a few months ago gives his India team confidence they can do it again in their Twenty20 World Cup semi-final on Thursday. The world's two top-ranked teams will clash at the Adelaide Oval for a place in Sunday's final at the MCG against Pakistan or New Zealand. India made the semis after winning four of their five Super 12 matches to top their group, but it's victories in July in the English summer that has buoyed Rohit. India edged out England 2-1 in both the T20 and 50-over series on their white-ball tour. ""Certainly going into the game it'll give us some confidence because beating a team like England in England, obviously it's a big challenge, and we overcame that challenge pretty well,"" Rohit said on Wednesday.
